                Let <m>K/F</m> be a field extension. A polynomial <m>f\in F[x]</m> <term>splits completely</term> over <m>K</m> if <m>f</m> factors over <m>K</m> as

                for some integer <m>n\geq 0</m>, constant <m>c\in F</m>,  and elements <m>\alpha_i\in K</m>. We say that the field <m>K</m> <term>splits</term> the polynomial <m>f</m> in this case.

                More generally, if <m>\mathcal{P}\subseteq F[x]</m> is a set of polynomials, we say that <m>K</m> splits <m>\mathcal{P}</m> if it splits each polynomial <m>f\in \mathcal{P}</m>.

                    It is clear that <m>F(A)</m> splits <m>\mathcal{P}</m>, since <m>A</m> contains all the roots of all the polynomials of <m>\mathcal{P}</m>. We must show that <m>F(A)/F</m> contains no proper subextension <m>K'/F</m> that splits <m>\mathcal{P}</m>. This is clear: if <m>K'/F</m> is a subextension of <m>F(A)/F</m>that splits <m>\mathcal{P}</m>, then <m>K'</m> must contain all roots of all polynomials of <m>\mathcal{P}</m>; that is, <m>K'</m> must contain <m>A</m>. Since by definition <m>F(A)</m> is the smallest extension of <m>K/F</m> containing <m>F</m> and <m>A</m>, we have <m>F(A)\leq K'</m>. Since <m>K'\leq F(A)</m>, we conclude <m>K'=F(A)</m>.

By induction there is a splitting field <m>L/F(\alpha_1)</m> of <m>g(x)</m> satisfying <m>[L\colon F(\alpha_1)]\leq (n-1)!</m>.
