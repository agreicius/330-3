    <title>Finite fields: existence and uniqueness</title>
    <p>
        As yet we have only seen two concrete examples of algebraic closure: the extensions <m>\C/\R</m> and <m>\overline{\Q}_\C/\Q</m>. The first example is about as simple as we could hope for: since <m>[\C\colon \R]=2</m>, elements of <m>\C</m> are easily described (<m>\alpha=r+si</m>, <m>r,s\in \R</m>), and furthermore there are no nontrivial subextensions of <m>\C/\R</m>. Contrast this with the situation for <m>\Q</m> and its algebraic closure <m>\overline{\Q}=\overline{\Q}_\C</m>. We have <m>[\overline{\Q}\colon \Q]=\infty</m>, there is no standard way of writing an arbitrary element of <m>\overline{Q}</m>, and there are infinitely many nontrivial subextensions. Indeed, there are even infinitely many subextensions of degree two!  
    </p>
    <p>
        In this and the next section we will investigate what the algebraic closure <m>\overline{\F_p}/\F_p</m> of the finite field <m>\F_p</m> looks like. Despite this algebraic closure being an infinite one, you will see that we can describe the subextensions of <m>\overline{\F_p}/\F_p</m> and their interdependence more or less explicitly. As such the example of an algebraic closure <m>\overline{\F_p}/\F_p</m> occupies a nice middle ground between our previous two examples. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For this and the next section <m>p</m> will always denote a prime integer.

            for all <m>r,s\in R</m> and all positive integers <m>n</m> is sometimes referred to as <q>the first-year's dream</q>.

        We are now ready to prove <xref ref="th_finite_fields"/>. 
    </p>
    <proof xml:base="proof_finite_fields">
        <title>Proof of <xref ref="th_finite_fields"/></title>
        <p>
            Fix positive integer <m>n</m>. Suppose <m>K/\F_p</m> is a field extension of degree <m>n</m>. Since <m>\dim_{\F_p} K=n</m>, we have <m>K\cong \F_p^n</m> and thus <m>\abs{K}=p^n</m>. Next, since <m>K^*</m> is a group of order <m>p^n-1</m>, we have <m>\alpha^{p^n-1}=1</m> for all <m>\alpha\in K-\{0\}</m>, which implies <m>\alpha^{p^n}-\alpha=0</m> for <em>all</em> elements <m>\alpha\in K</m> (including <m>0</m>). Since <m>K</m> has <m>p^n</m> elements, and since <m>f(x)=x^{p^n}-x</m> has at most <m>p^n</m> distinct roots, we see that we must have 
            <men xml:id="eq_def_K">
                K=\{\alpha\in\Fpbar\colon \alpha^{p^n}=\alpha\}
            </men>.
            In particular <m>K</m> splits <m>f(x)</m> and is minimal in this regard (by a counting argument). Thus <m>K</m> is a a splitting field of <m>f</m>.  
        </p>
        <p>
            So far, we have shown that there can be <em>at most</em> one subfield <m>K</m> of <m>\Fpbar</m> of degree <m>n</m>, that it is a splitting field of <m>f(x)=x^{p^n}-x</m>, and that it has the explicit description <xref ref="eq_def_K"/>. 
            Thus it remains to show that (a) the set <m>K</m> described by <xref ref="eq_def_K"/> is indeed a subfield of <m>\Fpbar</m>, and (b) that <m>\abs{K}=p^n</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It follows easily from the definition <xref ref="eq_def_K"/> that <m>K</m> contains <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>, and is closed under multiplication and inverses. It suffices then to show that <m>K</m> is closed under addition. To this end, given <m>\alpha,\beta\in K</m>, we have 
            <md>
                <mrow>(\alpha+\beta)^{p^r} \amp = \alpha^{p^r}+\beta^{p^r} \amp (\text{first-year's dream}) </mrow>
                <mrow> \amp =\alpha+\beta \amp (\alpha, \beta\in K)</mrow>
            </md>.
            This completes the proof that <m>K=\{\alpha\in\Fpbar\colon \alpha^{p^n}=\alpha\}</m> is a field. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Since <m>K</m> is by definition the set of all roots of <m>f(x)=x^{p^n}-x</m> in <m>\Fpbar</m>, it remains only to show that these roots are <em>distinct</em>: <ie/>, <m>f</m> has no repeated roots. Such polynomials are called <em>separable</em>, and we will have a lot more to say about this property in coming lectures, including some useful tools for proving that a polynomial is separable. We forego these tools for now and instead rely on some algebraic trickery.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Let <m>\alpha\in K</m> be a root of <m>f(x)</m>. Since <m>\alpha^{p^n}=\alpha</m>, we have 
            <md>
                <mrow>f(x) \amp = x^{p^n}-x-(\alpha^{p^n}-\alpha)</mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = x^{p^n}-\alpha^{p^n}-(x-\alpha)</mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = (x-\alpha)^{p^n}-(x-\alpha) \amp (\text{first-year's dream!})</mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = (x-\alpha)((x-\alpha)^{p^{n}-1}-1)</mrow>
                <mrow> \amp =(x-\alpha)g(x)</mrow>
            </md>,
            where <m>g(x)=(x-\alpha)^{p^{n}-1}-1</m>. Since <m>g(\alpha)=-1\ne 0</m>, we see that <m>\alpha</m> is not a root of <m>g(x)</m>. Since <m>f(x)=(x-\alpha)g(x)</m>, and <m>\alpha</m> is not a root of <m>g(x)</m>, we see that <m>\alpha</m> is not a repeated root of <m>f</m>, as desired. 
        </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
        We end this portion of our investigation of <m>\Fpbar/\F_p</m> with the claim that for all positive integers <m>n</m>, the unique subfield <m>K</m> of cardinality <m>n</m> is in fact a <em>simple extension</em> of <m>\F_p</m>. To prove this claim, we need the following cute application of the structure theorem of finitely generated abelian groups.

            Assume <m>\F_{p^m}\leq \F_{p^n}</m>. Applying the tower law to the tower <m>\F_p\leq \F_{p^m}\leq \F_{p^n}</m>, we see that <m>m=[\F_{p^m}\colon \F_p]</m> divides <m>n=[\F_{p^n}\colon \F_p]</m>.

            <p>
            If  <m>m\mid n</m>, then <m>n=mr</m> for some integer <m>r\geq 1</m>. We wish to show the implication 
            <me>
                \alpha\in \F_{p^m}\implies \alpha\in \F_{p^n}
            </me>.
            Recall our explicit descriptions of the two fields as subfields of <m>\Fpbar</m>: 
            <md>
                <mrow> \F_{p^m}\amp = \{\alpha\in \Fpbar\colon \alpha^{p^m}=\alpha\} </mrow>
                <mrow> \F_{p^n}\amp = \{\alpha\in \Fpbar\colon \alpha^{p^n}=\alpha\} </mrow>
            </md>.
             Define <m>\phi\colon \Fpbar\rightarrow \Fpbar</m> as <m>\phi(\alpha)=\alpha^{p^{m}}</m>, and let 
             <me>
                \phi^r=\underset{r \text{ times}}{\underbrace{\phi\circ\phi\circ\cdots \circ\phi}}
             </me>.
             An easy induction argument shows that <m>\phi^r(\alpha)=\alpha^{p^{mr}}</m>. Thus we have  
            <md>
                <mrow>\alpha\in \F_{p^m}\amp \implies \alpha^{p^{m}}=\alpha</mrow>
                <mrow> \amp\implies \phi(\alpha)=\alpha</mrow>
                <mrow> \amp \implies \phi^r(\alpha)=\alpha</mrow>
                <mrow> \amp \implies \alpha^{p^{mr}}=\alpha</mrow>
                <mrow> \amp \implies \alpha^{p^{n}}=\alpha</mrow>
                <mrow> \amp \implies \alpha\in \F_{p^{n}}</mrow>
            </md>,
            as desired. 
            </p>
            </case>
