                Let <m>K/F</m> be a finite field extension of degree <m>n=[K\colon F]</m>. The following statements are equivalent.

                            For any embedding <m>\sigma\colon F\rightarrow L</m>, with <m>L</m> algebraically closed, there are exactly <m>n=[K\colon F]</m> extensions of <m>\sigma</m> to <m>K</m>.

    <proof>
        <p>
            We prove the cycle of implications (1)<m>\implies</m>(2)<m>\implies</m>(3)<m>\implies</m>(1).
        </p>
        <case>
        <title>Implication:(1)<m>\implies</m>(2)</title>
        <p>
         Assume <m>K/F</m> is finite. We have <m>K=F(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots, \alpha_n)</m> for some elements <m>\alpha_i</m> by <xref ref="th_finite_ext"/>. Since <m>K/F</m> is separable, each <m>\alpha_i</m> is separable over <m>F</m>. 
        </p>
        </case>
        <case>
        <title>Implication:(2)<m>\implies</m>(3)</title>
        <p>
        Assume <m>K=F(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots, \alpha_n)</m> with each <m>\alpha_i</m> separable over <m>F</m>. We show by induction on <m>n</m> that <m>K/F</m> satisfies the condition described in (3).
        </p>
        <p>
            Base case: <m>n=1</m>. In this case we have <m>K=F(\alpha)</m>. Since <m>\alpha</m> is separable over <m>F</m>, its minimal polynomial <m>f(x)=m_{\alpha,F}(x)</m> is separable. Let <m>d=\deg f</m>. Given an embedding <m>\sigma\colon F\rightarrow L</m>, where <m>L</m> is algebraically closed, we know by <xref ref="th_embed_ext_simple"/> that the set <m>X</m> of all extensions of <m>\sigma</m> to <m>K=F(\alpha)</m> is in bijective correspondence with the set <m>R</m> of all roots in <m>L</m> of the polynomial <m>f^\sigma(x)</m>. Since <m>f</m> is separable, so is <m>f^\sigma</m>. (See proof below.) Since <m>\deg f=\deg f^\sigma</m>, and since <m>f^\sigma</m> splits completely over the algebraically closed field <m>L</m>, there are <m>d</m> distinct roots of <m>f^\sigma</m>. We conclude that 
            <me>
                \abs{X}=\abs{R}=d=[F(\alpha)\colon F]
            </me>,
            as desired. 
        </p>
        <p>
             To see why <m>f^\sigma</m> is separable, let <m>\beta_1,\beta_2,\dots,\beta_d</m> be the distinct roots of <m>f</m> lying in an algebraic closure <m>\overline{F}</m>. We can extend <m>\sigma</m> to an embedding <m>\sigma^*\colon \overline{F}\rightarrow L</m> by <xref ref="th_emb_ext_alg"/>, and it is easy to see that <m>\sigma^*(\beta_i)</m> are the distinct roots of <m>f^\sigma</m>, which also has degree <m>d</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Induction case: let <m>n&gt; 1</m> and assume the result holds for any field extension separably generated by <m>n-1</m> elements. Given <m>K=F(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots, \alpha_n)</m>, we have <m>K=K'(\alpha_n)</m>, where <m>K'=F(\alpha_1,\dots, \alpha_{n-1})</m>. Let <m>[K\colon K']=e</m> and <m>[K'\colon F]=d</m>, so that 
            <me>
                n=[K\colon F]=[K\colon K']\, [K'\colon F]=e\, d
            </me>.
            By the induction hypothesis, given any <m>\sigma\colon F\rightarrow L</m> with <m>L</m> algebraically closed, there are exactly <m>d=[K'\colon F]</m> extensions <m>\tau'\colon K'\rightarrow L</m> of <m>\sigma</m> to <m>K'</m>. Applying the base case (<m>n=1</m>) to the simple extension <m>K=K'(\alpha_n)</m>, for each such <m>\tau'\colon K'\rightarrow L</m> extending <m>\sigma</m> there are exactly <m>e=[K'(\alpha)\colon K']</m> extensions of <m>\tau'</m> to an embedding <m>\tau\colon K=K'(\alpha)\colon L</m>. We now use our <xref ref="lem_count_ext" text="custom">counting extensions of embeddings lemma</xref>. Let <m>X</m> be the set of all extensions of <m>\sigma</m> to <m>K</m>, let <m>X'</m> be the set of all extensions of <m>\sigma</m> to <m>K'</m>, and for each <m>\tau'\in X'</m>, let <m>X_{\tau'}</m> be the set of all extensions of <m>\tau'</m> to <m>K</m>. (See <xref ref="fig_cor_embed_ext_finite"/> for a visual summary of this setup.) Using <xref ref="lem_count_ext"/>, we have

                <mrow> \amp =\sum_{\tau'\in X'}e \amp (\text{base step})</mrow>

                <mrow> \amp = n \amp (\text{tower law})</mrow>
            </md>,
            as desired. 
        </p>
        </case>
        <case>
            <title>Implication:(3)<m>\implies</m>(1)</title>
            <p>
                Assume <m>K/F</m> is finite and satisfies the condition described in (3). Let <m>\overline{F}/F</m> be an algebraic closure of <m>F</m>. Fix an <m>\alpha\in K</m>, and let <m>f(x)=m_{\alpha,F}(x)</m>. Assume <m>\deg f=d</m>. We wish to show that <m>f</m> is separable, or equivalently, that the set <m>R=\{\beta\in \overline{F}\colon f(\beta)\}</m> of roots of <m>f</m> has exactly <m>d</m> elements: <ie/>, <m>\abs{R}=d</m>. To this end, we apply condition (3) to the field embedding <m>i\colon F\rightarrow \overline{F}</m>. Namely, the set of extensions <m>X</m> of <m>i\colon F\rightarrow \overline{F}</m> to an embedding <m>\tau\colon K\rightarrow \overline{F}</m> has cardinality <m>\abs{X}=n</m>. On the other hand, we have the tower of extensions <m>K/K'/F</m>, where <m>K'=F(\alpha)</m>, and applying the <xref ref="lem_count_ext" text="custom">counting extensions of embeddings lemma</xref>, we see that 
                <md>
                    <mrow> n=\abs{X}\amp=\sum_{\tau'\in X'}X_{\tau'} </mrow>
                </md>,
                where <m>X'</m> is the set of all extensions of <m>i\colon F\rightarrow \overline{F}</m> to <m>K'=F(\alpha)</m>, and for each <m>\tau'\in X'</m>, <m>X_{\tau'}</m> is the set of all extensions of <m>\tau'</m> to <m>K</m>. (Again, see <xref ref="fig_cor_embed_ext_finite"/> for a visual summary of this setup.) Since <m>K'=F(\alpha)</m> is simple, we have <m>\abs{X'}\leq \abs{R}</m>, the number of distinct roots of <m>f</m> in <m>\overline{R}</m>, by <xref ref="th_embed_ext_simple"/>. Furthermore, for each <m>\tau'\in X'</m>, we have <m>\abs{X_{\tau'}}\leq [K\colon K']=e</m> by <xref ref="th_emb_ext_finite"/>. Thus we have 
                <md>
                    <mrow> n=\abs{X}\amp=\sum_{\tau'\in X'}X_{\tau'} </mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp \leq\sum_{tau'\in X'}e </mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp =e\abs{X'}</mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp \leq e\,d</mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp = n</mrow>
                </md>.
                It follows that the two inequalities above are in fact equalities, and thus in particular, that <m>d=\abs{X'}=\abs{R}</m>. Thus <m>f</m> is separable, as desired. 
            </p>
            </case>

    <title>Maximal separable degree</title>
    <p>
        Given a finite field extension <m>K/F</m> of degree <m>[K\colon F]=n</m>, its <em>separable degree</em> is defined as the the number of distinct extensions to <m>K</m> of any embedding <m>\sigma\colon F\rightarrow L</m>, where <m>L</m> is algebraically closed, and is denoted <m>[K\colon F]^s</m>. (You can show that this number is independent of the choice of algebraically closed field <m>L</m> and embedding <m>\sigma\colon F\rightarrow L</m>.) By <xref ref="th_emb_ext_finite"/> this number <m></m>of extensions is <em>at most</em> <m>n=[K\colon F]</m>. According to <xref ref="th_sep_fin_ext"/>, the extension <m>K/F</m> is separable if and only if the number of extensions is <em>equal</em> to <m>n=[K\colon F]</m>. Thus <m>K/F</m> is separable if and only if it has <q>maximal separable degree</q> <m>n=[K\colon F]</m>.

        <title>Separable is separably generated</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
            A field extension <m>K/F</m> is separable if and only if there is a set <m>A\subseteq K</m> of separable elements such that <m>K=F(A)</m>. In plain English: an extension is separable if and only if it is separably generated. 
            </p>
        </statement>
        <proof>
            <p>
                The forward implication is easy: if <m>K/F</m> is separable, then all elements of <m>K</m> are separable over <m>F</m>, and we have <m>K=F(A)</m>, where <m>A=K</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's prove the reverse implication. Assume <m>A</m> is a collection of separable elements of <m>K</m> that generate <m>K</m> over <m>F</m>: <ie/>, such that <m>K=F(A)</m>. Recall that we have 
                <me>
                    K=F(A)=\bigcup_{\substack{A'\subseteq A\\ A' \text{ finit}}}F(A')
                </me>
                by <xref ref="th_fin_gen"/>. Thus, given <m>\alpha\in K</m>, we have 
                <me>
                    \alpha\in F(A')=F(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots, \alpha_n)
                </me>
                for some finite set <m>A'=\{\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots, \alpha_n\}\subseteq A</m>. Since by assumption <m>A</m> consists of separable elements, the extension <m>F(A')/F</m> is finitely separably generated over <m>F</m>, and hence separable by <xref ref="th_sep_fin_ext"/>. It follows that <m>\alpha</m> is separable over <m>F</m>, as desired. 
            </p>
        </proof>
    </corollary>
    <corollary xml:id="cor_sep_strong_trans">
        <title>Separability is strongly transitive</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Let <m>L/K/F</m> be a tower of algebraic field extensions. The extension <m>L/F</m> is separable if and only if <m>L/K</m> and <m>K/F</m> are both separable. Using logical shorthand:

        </statement>
        <proof>
            <p>
                We prove both implications separately.

            Assume <m>L/F</m> is separable. Clearly then <m>K/F</m> is separable, since if <m>\alpha\in K</m>, then <m>\alpha\in L</m>, and hence satisfies a separable polynomial over <m>F</m> since <m>L/F</m> is separable. 
            </p>
            <p> Similarly, to see that <m>L/K</m> is separable, observe that given <m>\alpha\in L</m>, its minimal polynomial <m>m_{\alpha,F}(x)\in F[x]</m> is separable. Since <m>F\leq K</m>, we have <m>m_{\alpha, F}(x)\in K[x]</m>. Thus <m>\alpha</m> satisfies a separable polynomial over <m>K</m>.

                K'=F(\alpha_0,\alpha_1,\dots, \alpha_{n-1}).
            </me>
            Since each <m>\alpha_i\in K</m> is separable over <m>F</m>, <m>K'</m> is separable (and finite) over <m>F</m> by <xref ref="th_sep_fin_ext"/>. Furthermore, <m>K'(\alpha)/K'</m> is algebraic since <m>\alpha</m> satisfies the separable polynomial <m>m_{\alpha,K}(x)\in K'[x]\leq K[x]</m>. Let <m>[K'(\alpha)\colon K']=e</m> and <m>[K'\colon F]=d</m> so that 
            <me>
                [K'(\alpha)\colon F]=[K'(\alpha)\colon K'][K'\colon F]=e\,d
            </me>.
            We will use condition (3) of <xref ref="th_sep_fin_ext"/> to prove <m>K'(\alpha)/F</m> is separable, which then implies <m>\alpha</m> is separable over <m>F</m>. Given an embedding <m>\sigma\colon F\rightarrow L</m>, where <m>L</m> is algebraically closed, since <m>K'/F</m> is separable, the set <m>X'</m> of extensions of <m>\sigma</m> to <m>K'</m> has cardinality <m>\abs{X'}=[K'\colon F]=d</m> by <xref ref="th_sep_fin_ext"/>.
