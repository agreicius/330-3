    <title>Separable finite extensions</title>
    <p>
        In this section we re-cast the notion of separability in terms of extensions of embeddings. The two concepts seem quite removed from one another until you consider the special case of a simple algebraic extension <m>F(\alpha)/F</m>. Let <m>f(x)=m_{\alpha,F}(x)</m>, and let <m>n=\deg f</m>. As we saw in <xref ref="th_embed_ext_simple"/>, given an embedding <m>\sigma\colon F\rightarrow L</m>, the set of extensions of <m>\sigma</m> to <m>F(\alpha)</m> is in bijective correspondence with the set of roots of <m>f^\sigma(x)\in L[x]</m>. The number of these roots is at most <m>n</m> (since <m>\deg f^\sigma=\deg f=n</m>), and is equal to <m>n</m> exactly when <m>f</m> (and <m>f^\sigma</m>) have <m>n</m> distinct roots: <ie/>, when <m>f</m> is separable. This is the crucial idea behind the proof of <xref ref="th_sep_fin_ext"/>, which gives us a characterization of separability in terms of extensions of embeddings. This equivalent formulation, abstract as it might sound, is very useful as a means of verifying that a field extension is separable.

    <proof>
        <p>
            We prove the cycle of implications (1)<m>\implies</m>(2)<m>\implies</m>(3)<m>\implies</m>(1).
        </p>
        <case>
        <title>Implication:(1)<m>\implies</m>(2)</title>
        <p>
         Assume <m>K/F</m> is finite. We have <m>K=F(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots, \alpha_n)</m> for some elements <m>\alpha_i</m> by <xref ref="th_finite_ext"/>. Since <m>K/F</m> is separable, each <m>\alpha_i</m> is separable over <m>F</m>. 
        </p>
        </case>
        <case>
        <title>Implication:(2)<m>\implies</m>(3)</title>
        <p>
        Assume <m>K=F(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots, \alpha_n)</m> with each <m>\alpha_i</m> separable over <m>F</m>. We show by induction on <m>n</m> that <m>K/F</m> satisfies the condition described in (3).
        </p>
        <p>
            Base case: <m>n=1</m>. In this case we have <m>K=F(\alpha)</m>. Since <m>\alpha</m> is separable over <m>F</m>, its minimal polynomial <m>f(x)=m_{\alpha,F}(x)</m> is separable. Let <m>d=\deg f</m>. Given an embedding <m>\sigma\colon F\rightarrow L</m>, where <m>L</m> is algebraically closed, we know by <xref ref="th_embed_ext_simple"/> that the set <m>X</m> of all extensions of <m>\sigma</m> to <m>K=F(\alpha)</m> is in bijective correspondence with the set <m>R</m> of all roots in <m>L</m> of the polynomial <m>f^\sigma(x)</m>. Since <m>f</m> is separable, so is <m>f^\sigma</m>. (See proof below.) Since <m>\deg f=\deg f^\sigma</m>, and since <m>f^\sigma</m> splits completely over the algebraically closed field <m>L</m>, there are <m>d</m> distinct roots of <m>f^\sigma</m>. We conclude that 
            <me>
                \abs{X}=\abs{R}=d=[F(\alpha)\colon F]
            </me>,
            as desired. 
        </p>
        <p>
             To see why <m>f^\sigma</m> is separable, let <m>\beta_1,\beta_2,\dots,\beta_d</m> be the distinct roots of <m>f</m> lying in an algebraic closure <m>\overline{F}</m>. We can extend <m>\sigma</m> to an embedding <m>\sigma^*\colon \overline{F}\rightarrow L</m> by <xref ref="th_emb_ext_alg"/>, and it is easy to see that <m>\sigma^*(\beta_i)</m> are the distinct roots of <m>f^\sigma</m>, which also has degree <m>d</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Induction case: let <m>n&gt; 1</m> and assume the result holds for any field extension separably generated by <m>n-1</m> elements. Given <m>K=F(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots, \alpha_n)</m>, we have <m>K=K'(\alpha_n)</m>, where <m>K'=F(\alpha_1,\dots, \alpha_{n-1})</m>. Let <m>[K\colon K']=e</m> and <m>[K'\colon F]=d</m>, so that 
            <me>
                n=[K\colon F]=[K\colon K']\, [K'\colon F]=e\, d
            </me>.
            By the induction hypothesis, given any <m>\sigma\colon F\rightarrow L</m> with <m>L</m> algebraically closed, there are exactly <m>d=[K'\colon F]</m> extensions <m>\tau'\colon K'\rightarrow L</m> of <m>\sigma</m> to <m>K'</m>. Applying the base case (<m>n=1</m>) to the simple extension <m>K=K'(\alpha_n)</m>, for each such <m>\tau'\colon K'\rightarrow L</m> extending <m>\sigma</m> there are exactly <m>e=[K'(\alpha)\colon K']</m> extensions of <m>\tau'</m> to an embedding <m>\tau\colon K=K'(\alpha)\colon L</m>. We now use our <xref ref="lem_count_ext" text="custom">counting extensions of embeddings lemma</xref>. Let <m>X</m> be the set of all extensions of <m>\sigma</m> to <m>K</m>, let <m>X'</m> be the set of all extensions of <m>\sigma</m> to <m>K'</m>, and for each <m>\tau'\in X'</m>, let <m>X_{\tau'}</m> be the set of all extensions of <m>\tau'</m> to <m>K</m>. (See <xref ref="fig_cor_embed_ext_finite"/> for a visual summary of this setup.) Using <xref ref="lem_count_ext"/>, we have

        <case>
            <title>Implication:(3)<m>\implies</m>(1)</title>
            <p>
                Assume <m>K/F</m> is finite and satisfies the condition described in (3). Let <m>\overline{F}/F</m> be an algebraic closure of <m>F</m>. Fix an <m>\alpha\in K</m>, and let <m>f(x)=m_{\alpha,F}(x)</m>. Assume <m>\deg f=d</m>. We wish to show that <m>f</m> is separable, or equivalently, that the set <m>R=\{\beta\in \overline{F}\colon f(\beta)\}</m> of roots of <m>f</m> has exactly <m>d</m> elements: <ie/>, <m>\abs{R}=d</m>. To this end, we apply condition (3) to the field embedding <m>i\colon F\rightarrow \overline{F}</m>. Namely, the set of extensions <m>X</m> of <m>i\colon F\rightarrow \overline{F}</m> to an embedding <m>\tau\colon K\rightarrow \overline{F}</m> has cardinality <m>\abs{X}=n</m>. On the other hand, we have the tower of extensions <m>K/K'/F</m>, where <m>K'=F(\alpha)</m>, and applying the <xref ref="lem_count_ext" text="custom">counting extensions of embeddings lemma</xref>, we see that 
                <md>
                    <mrow> n=\abs{X}\amp=\sum_{\tau'\in X'}X_{\tau'} </mrow>
                </md>,
                where <m>X'</m> is the set of all extensions of <m>i\colon F\rightarrow \overline{F}</m> to <m>K'=F(\alpha)</m>, and for each <m>\tau'\in X'</m>, <m>X_{\tau'}</m> is the set of all extensions of <m>\tau'</m> to <m>K</m>. (Again, see <xref ref="fig_cor_embed_ext_finite"/> for a visual summary of this setup.) Since <m>K'=F(\alpha)</m> is simple, we have <m>\abs{X'}\leq \abs{R}</m>, the number of distinct roots of <m>f</m> in <m>\overline{R}</m>, by <xref ref="th_embed_ext_simple"/>. Furthermore, for each <m>\tau'\in X'</m>, we have <m>\abs{X_{\tau'}}\leq [K\colon K']=e</m> by <xref ref="th_emb_ext_finite"/>. Thus we have 
                <md>
                    <mrow> n=\abs{X}\amp=\sum_{\tau'\in X'}X_{\tau'} </mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp \leq\sum_{tau'\in X'}e </mrow>

                    <mrow> \amp = n</mrow>
                </md>.
                It follows that the two inequalities above are in fact equalities, and thus in particular, that <m>d=\abs{X'}=\abs{R}</m>. Thus <m>f</m> is separable, as desired.

    <title>Maximal separable degree</title>
    <p>
        Given a finite field extension <m>K/F</m> of degree <m>[K\colon F]=n</m>, its <em>separable degree</em> is defined as the the number of distinct extensions to <m>K</m> of any embedding <m>\sigma\colon F\rightarrow L</m>, where <m>L</m> is algebraically closed, and is denoted <m>[K\colon F]^s</m>. (You can show that this number is independent of the choice of algebraically closed field <m>L</m> and embedding <m>\sigma\colon F\rightarrow L</m>.) By <xref ref="th_emb_ext_finite"/> this number <m></m>of extensions is <em>at most</em> <m>n=[K\colon F]</m>. According to <xref ref="th_sep_fin_ext"/>, the extension <m>K/F</m> is separable if and only if the number of extensions is <em>equal</em> to <m>n=[K\colon F]</m>. Thus <m>K/F</m> is separable if and only if it has <q>maximal separable degree</q> <m>n=[K\colon F]</m>.

        <title>Separable is separably generated</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
            A field extension <m>K/F</m> is separable if and only if there is a set <m>A\subseteq K</m> of separable elements such that <m>K=F(A)</m>. In plain English: an extension is separable if and only if it is separably generated.

        </statement>
        <proof>
            <p>
                The forward implication is easy: if <m>K/F</m> is separable, then all elements of <m>K</m> are separable over <m>F</m>, and we have <m>K=F(A)</m>, where <m>A=K</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's prove the reverse implication. Assume <m>A</m> is a collection of separable elements of <m>K</m> that generate <m>K</m> over <m>F</m>: <ie/>, such that <m>K=F(A)</m>. Recall that we have 
                <me>

                </me>
                by <xref ref="th_fin_gen"/>. Thus, given <m>\alpha\in K</m>, we have

                    \alpha\in F(A')=F(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots, \alpha_n)
                </me>
                for some finite set <m>A'=\{\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots, \alpha_n\}\subseteq A</m>. Since by assumption <m>A</m> consists of separable elements, the extension <m>F(A')/F</m> is finitely separably generated over <m>F</m>, and hence separable by <xref ref="th_sep_fin_ext"/>. It follows that <m>\alpha</m> is separable over <m>F</m>, as desired.

            <p>
                First consider the case where <m>F</m>, and hence also <m>K</m>, is a finite field. Since <m>K</m> is finite, we have <m>K^*=\langle \alpha\rangle=\{1,\alpha,\alpha^2,\dots, \alpha^r\}</m> for some <m>\alpha</m>, in which case clearly <m>K=F(\alpha)</m>, as desired. 
            </p>
            <p>
                From now on we assume <m>F</m> is infinite. Since <m>K/F</m> is finite, we can write <m>K=F(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots, \alpha_n)</m>. We will show by induction on <m>n</m> that if <m>K</m> is separable, then <m>K=F(\alpha)</m> for some <m>\alpha\in K</m>.  The base case <m>n=1</m> is trivial.

            <p>
                For the induction argument, given a separable extension <m>K=F(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots, \alpha_n)</m>, by induction <m>F(\alpha_1,\dots, \alpha_{n-1})=F(\alpha)</m> for some <m>\alpha</m>, in which case <m>K=F(\alpha, \alpha_n)</m>. Thus, to complete the proof it suffices to show that if <m>K=F(\alpha,\beta)</m> is separable, then we have <m>K=F(\gamma)</m> for some <m>\gamma\in K</m>. In fact, we will show that we can pick <m>\gamma=\alpha+c\beta</m> for some <m>c\in F</m>, and this is precisely where we will use the fact that <m>F</m> is infinite. 
                In more detail, we will show that the set of <m>c\in F</m> such that <m>F(\alpha+c\beta)\ne K</m> is finite, and thus, since <m>F</m> is infinite, there is a <m>c\in F</m> such that <m>F(\alpha+c\beta)=K</m>.

            <p>
                Here is where we use the fact that <m>K=F(\alpha,\beta)</m> is separable over <m>F</m>. Let <m>[K\colon F]=n</m>, and let <m>X=\{\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\dots, \sigma_n\}</m> be the <m>n</m> extensions of the inclusion map <m>i\colon F\hookrightarrow \overline{F}</m>, for some algebraic closure <m>\overline{F}/F</m>. If <m>K'=F(\alpha+c\beta)\ne K</m>, then we have <m>[K\colon K']</m>.

By strong transitivity, <m>K/K'</m> is separable; and since <m>[K\colon K']&gt; 1</m>, there are <em>at least</em> two distinct extensions <m>\tau_i\ne \tau_j\in X</m> of <m>\sigma</m> to <m>K</m>.

                Since <m>\tau_i\vert_{K'}=\tau_j\vert_{K'}=\sigma</m>, we have 
                <me>
                    \tau_i(\alpha+c\beta)=\tau_j(\alpha+c\beta)
                </me>,
                and thus
                <me>
                    \tau_i(\alpha)+c\tau_i(\beta)=\tau_j(\alpha)+c\tau_j(\beta)
                </me>.
                If <m>\tau_i(\beta)=\tau_j(\beta)</m>, then we'd also have <m>\tau_i(\alpha)=\tau_j(\alpha)</m>, in which case <m>\tau_i=\tau_j</m>, since <m>K=F(\alpha,\beta)</m>. This is a contradiction, as we assumed <m>\tau_i\ne \tau_j</m>. We conclude that <m>\tau_i(\beta)\ne \tau_j(\beta)</m>, in which case we can solve for <m>c</m> as 
                <me>
                    c=\frac{\tau_i(\alpha)-\tau_{j}(\alpha)}{\tau_i(\beta)-\tau_{j}(\beta)}
                </me>.
                This means that <m>c</m> must be an element of the <em>finite</em> set of elements 
                <me>
                    \left\{\frac{\tau(\alpha)-\tau'(\alpha)}{\tau(\beta)-\tau'(\beta)}\colon \tau\ne \tau'\in X, \tau(\beta)\ne\tau'(\beta) \right\}
                </me>.
                It follows that there are only finitely many such <m>c\in F</m> for which <m>F(\alpha+c\beta)\ne F(\alpha,\beta)</m>, as desired.

        <p>
            Given a simple algebraic extension <m>K=F(\alpha)</m>, the simple generator <m>\alpha</m> is often called a <em>primitive element</em>. Thus the primitive element theorem can be summarized as follows: every finite separable extension has a primitive element.
