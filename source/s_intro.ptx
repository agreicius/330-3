        <title>Finding roots of polynomials</title>
        
	<p>
		Given a degree-2 polynomial <m>f(x)=ax^2+bx+c</m> with coefficients in <m>\R</m> (or <m>\Q</m>, or <m>\C</m>), we may compute its roots using the <em>quadratic formula</em>:
		<men xml:id="eq_quad_formula">
			x=\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
		</men>.
		The question naturally arises whether we can derive a formula of a similar nature to <xref ref="eq_quad_formula"/> for the roots of polynomials of <em>higher degree</em>.
		For example, if <m>f(x)=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d</m>, then the roots of <m>f</m> can be expressed in the form
		<mdn>
			<mrow number="no">x \amp = \frac{b}{3a}+\sqrt[3]{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{2b^3}{27a^3}-\frac{bc}{a^2}+\frac{d}{a}\right)+\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{2b^3}{27a^3}-\frac{bc}{a^2}+\frac{d}{a}\right)^2+\frac{1}{27}\left(\frac{c}{a}-\frac{b^2}{3a^2}\right)^3}}</mrow>
			<mrow xml:id="eq_cubic_formula"> \amp + \sqrt[3]{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{2b^3}{27a^3}-\frac{bc}{a^2}+\frac{d}{a}\right)-\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{2b^3}{27a^3}-\frac{bc}{a^2}+\frac{d}{a}\right)^2+\frac{1}{27}\left(\frac{c}{a}-\frac{b^2}{3a^2}\right)^3}}</mrow>
		</mdn>.
		This formula, along with similar formulas for quartic polynomials, was published in Geralamo Cardano's <em>Ars Magna</em> in the 16th century.
		As such these formulas are called <em>Cardano's formulas</em>.
		However, Cardano was building off work of a number of other Italian mathematicians: <eg/>, Scipione del Ferro, Niccolo Tartaglia, and Lodovico Ferrari.
		See <url href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-scandalous-history-of-the-cubic-formula-20220630/">The sordid past of the cubic formula</url> for an amusing history of the attribution struggle around these results.
	</p>

	<p>
		Comparing <xref ref="eq_quad_formula"/> and <xref ref="eq_cubic_formula"/>, it is clear that though the second formula is quite a deal more complicated than the first, it is indeed similar in nature.
		Namely, the root <m>x</m> is expressed in terms of iterated radical expressions (radicals of radicals): we say that the polynomial <m>f</m> is <em>solvable by radicals</em> in this case. 
	</p>
    <p>
        So are all polynomials solvable by radicals? Although the answer is yes for any quadratic, cubic, or quartic polynomial, Niels Henrik Abel was able to show in the early 19th century that the answer is no for certain quintic (degree-5) polynomials. Around the same time Ã‰variste Galois characterized exactly which polynomials <m>f</m> were solvable by radicals in terms of a group <m>G_f</m> of automorphisms of a certain field <m>K_f</m> associated to <m>f</m>. The theory he developed to this end, now called <em>Galois theory</em>, established an extremely powerful dictionary between field extensions and groups of field automorphisms. Galois's work is often heralded as the beginning of group theory itself, so in taking up Galois theory now we come wonderfully full circle.

                In this course all rings <m>R</m> are assumed to have a multiplicative identity element. By default the additive identity element of <m>R</m> is denoted <m>0</m> (or <m>0_R</m>), and the multiplicative identity element is denoted <m>1</m> (or <m>1_R</m>).

        Recall that if <m>R</m> is an integral domain, then its <term>field of fractions</term> <m>\Frac R</m> is defined formally as
