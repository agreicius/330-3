        <title>Dihedral groups</title>
        <p>
            The <m>n</m>-th dihedral group <m>D_n</m> is sometime defined geometrically as the group of all rotations and permutations of a regular <m>n</m>-gon <m>\mathcal{P}\subseteq \R^2</m> centered at the origin and including <m>(1,0)</m> as one of its vertices. For example, <m>D_4</m> is the group of rotations and reflections of the square with vertices <m>(1,0),(0,1),(-1,0),(0,-1)</m>. It is typically shown that these sets constitute a group under composition of functions, that <m>\abs{D_n}=2n</m>, and that <m>D_n</m> is generated by elements <m>r</m> and <m>s</m>, where <m>r</m> is rotation by <m>\theta=2\pi/n</m> and <m>s</m> is reflection through the <m>x</m>-axis. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This geometric definition of <m>D_n</m> has the advantage of being concrete and easy to visualize, and the disadvantage of being difficult to work with when computing examples. An alternative approach defines <m>D_n</m> more formally as the set <m>2n</m> distinct expressions <m>r^js^k</m>, where <m>0\leq j\leq n-1</m> and <m>0\leq k\leq 1</m>. The group operation is then <q>summarized</q> as follows: given two elements <m>g_1=r^{j_1}s^{k_1}</m> and <m>g_2=r^{j_2}s^{k_2}</m>, we compute their product

            by using the simplification rules

                <mrow>r^n \amp =s^2=1 \amp sr\amp=r^{n-1}s</mrow>
            </md>.
            From these simplification rules we can further derive the following inverse rules:
            <md>
                <mrow>r^{-1} \amp = r^{n-1}  \amp (r^{j})^{-1}\amp = r^{n-j} \amp s^{-1}\amp= s</mrow>

                                    Since <m>sr=r^{n-1}s=r^{-1}s</m>, it follows easily by induction that <m>sr^k=r^{n-k}s=r^{-k}s</m>. Thus

            As you might guess, this description of a group operation by way of <q>simplification rules</q> is not entirely rigorous. In particular, who is to say that the resulting operation is even associative? The theory of <em>free groups</em> and <em>group presentations</em> is what is needed to put this construction on firm ground. We will not go into this theory here, and will instead content ourselves with declaring that our formal description of <m>D_n</m> does in fact provide a well-defined group. We will also make use of group presentation notation to summarize our definition of <m>D_n</m> as follows: 
            <me>
                D_n=\angvec{r,s\colon r^n=s^2=1, sr=r^{n-1}s=r^{-1}s}
            </me>.
            This notation reads as follows: <q><m>D_n</m> is the unique group generated by elements <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> satisfying the relations <m>r^n=s^2=1</m> and <m>sr=r^{n-1}s=r^{-1}s</m></q>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The following theorem is extremely useful for producing a group homomorphism <m>\phi\colon D_n\rightarrow G</m> from a dihedral group to some target group <m>G</m>. It says (a) that any such homomorphism is uniquely determined by the images <m>\phi(r)=g_r</m> and <m>\phi(s)=g_s</m>, since then we must have <m>\phi(r^{j}s^k)=g_r^{j}g_s^{k}</m>
