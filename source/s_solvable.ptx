            Consider the Cardano formula for finding roots of a cubic polynomial.

                        Let <m>F</m> be a field satisfying <m>\character F\ne 2,3</m>, and let <m>\zeta\in \overline{F}</m> be a primitive cube-root of unity. Given a cubic polynomial <m>f</m> of the form <m>f(x)=x^3+ax+b\in F[x]</m>, the roots <m>\alpha, \beta,\gamma\in \overline{F}</m> of <m>f</m> can be expressed as

                        and <m>\theta_2</m> is the unique cube-root of 
                        <me>
                            -\frac{27b}{2}-\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{-3\Delta_f}
                        </me>
                        that also satisfies

                        In particular, all roots of <m>f</m> can be expressed in the form

                            \frac{1}{3}\left( \sqrt[3]{ -\frac{27b}{2}+\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{-3\Delta_f}}+\sqrt[3]{ -\frac{27b}{2}-\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{-3\Delta_f}}\right)

            We will not give the proof of Cardano's theorem here. Instead we will (a) try and better understand the particular nature of an expression like <xref ref="eq_Cardano_summary"/>, and (b) ask why we would even hope for an expression like this for the roots of a polynomial. In this spirit, let's first zoom out from the details of Cardano's formula and locate where this expression lives inside a field extension diagram. According to <xref ref="th_cubic_split"/>, the splitting field of <m>f</m> is <m>K_f=F(\alpha, \sqrt{\Delta_f})</m>, as summarized by the following field diagram.

        <p>
        From the Galois correspondence theorem, we know that <m>K_f/F(\sqrt{\Delta_f})</m> is a Galois extension of degree <m>3</m>, with cyclic Galois group. You might hope that there is a chance that elements of <m>K_f</m> (including <m>\alpha, \beta, \gamma</m>) could be expressed in terms of cube-roots of elements of <m>F(\sqrt{\Delta})</m>, and yet in Cardano's formula <xref ref="eq_Cardano_summary"/>, we see that <m>\sqrt{-3\Delta_f}</m> appears, an element in the enlarged field 
        <me>F(\sqrt{\Delta_f}, \zeta)=F(\sqrt{\Delta_f},\sqrt{-3})</me> obtained by adding <m>\zeta</m> into the mix. This is summarized as follows.

        <p>
            In light of our field diagram, we see that Cardano's formula <xref ref="eq_Cardano_summary"/> can be understood as expressing the roots of <m>f</m> in terms of cube-roots of elements of the field <m>F(\sqrt{\Delta_f}, \zeta)</m>. But why couldn't we have done this over the field <m>F(\sqrt{\Delta_f})</m>? In other words, why did we have to chuck in <m>\zeta</m>? It is not difficult to see that the degree <m>d</m> of <m>K_f(\zeta)/F(\sqrt{\Delta_f},\zeta)</m> is 3 or 1, depending on whether <m>\zeta\in F(\sqrt{\Delta_f})</m>. Thus if <m>\zeta</m> is not an element of <m>F(\sqrt{\Delta_f})</m>, the extension <m>K_f(\zeta)/F(\sqrt{\Delta_f},\zeta)</m>, like <m>K_f/F(\sqrt{\Delta_f})</m>, is Galois of degree <m>3</m>. We will now uncover why a Cardano-like formula is possible for elements of a field extension like <m>K_f(\zeta)/F(\sqrt{\Delta_f},\zeta)</m>, and not necessarily possible for elements of an extension like <m>K_f/F(\sqrt{\Delta_f})</m>.

            Note well that whereas by definition a cyclic extension is Galois, a radical extension need not by: as a familiar example, consider the non-Galois simple radical extension <m>\Q(\sqrt[3]{2})/\Q</m>.  As a consequence of the next theorem, however, we see that this issue disappears if our ground field has enough cyclotomic elements of the right order. More precisely, if <m>\character F\nmid n</m>, and if <m>F</m> contains a primitive <m>n</m>-th root of unity, then for all <m>d\mid n</m>, a degree-<m>d</m> extension of <m>F</m> is radical if and only if it is cyclic.

                                Given any <m>a\in F</m>, the simple radical extension <m>F(\sqrt[n]{a})/F</m> is cyclic and <m>[F(\sqrt[n]{a})\colon F]\mid n</m>.

                                Let <m>K=F(\alpha)</m>, where <m>\alpha=\sqrt[n]{a}</m> is an <m>n</m>-th root of an element <m>a\in F</m>. We must show that <m>K/F</m> is Galois, and that its Galois group is cyclic. If <m>a=0</m>, then <m>K=F</m>, in which case both claims are obvious. Assume henceforth that <m>a\ne 0</m>. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                 Let <m>f(x)=x^n-a</m>. We claim that <m>K=K_f</m>: <ie/>, <m>K</m> is the splitting field of <m>x^n-a</m>. Since clearly <m>K\leq K_f</m>, it suffices to show (by minimality) that <m>f</m> splits completely in <m>K</m>. But if <m>\beta</m> is a root of <m>f</m>, then <m>\alpha^n=\beta^n=a</m>, in which case <m>(\alpha/\beta)^n=1</m>. Thus <m>\alpha/\beta\in \mu_n=\angvec{\zeta}</m>, showing that <m>\alpha/\beta=\zeta^k</m> for some <m>k</m>, and hence <m>\beta=\alpha\zeta^{-k}\in K</m>, since <m>\zeta\in F</m>. Thus <m>f</m> splits completely in <m>K</m>, as desired. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              To see that <m>K/F</m> is separable, note that <m>f'(x)=nx^{n-1}</m>. Since <m>\character F\nmid n</m>, <m>f'(x)</m> is a nonzero polynomial whose only irreducible factor is <m>x</m>. Since <m>x</m> is not a factor <m>f(x)</m>, we see that <m>(f,f')=1</m>, and hence that <m>f</m> is a separable polynomial. Since <m>K=K_f</m> is generated over <m>F</m> by the roots of <m>f</m>, we conclude that <m>K/F</m> is separable. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lastly, we show that <m>G=\Gal(K/F)</m> is cyclic. The usual argument shows that for any <m>\sigma\in G</m>, we must have 
                                <me>
                                    \alpha\xmapsto{\ \sigma \ } \alpha \zeta_\sigma
                                </me>
                                for a unique <m>n</m>-th root of unity <m>\zeta_\sigma\in \mu_n=\angvec{\zeta}</m>, and further more that <m>\sigma</m> is uniquely determined by this value <m>\sigma(\alpha)=\zeta_\sigma</m>. It follows that the map 
                                <md>
                                    <mrow>\phi\colon G \amp \rightarrow \mu_n</mrow>
                                    <mrow>\sigma \amp \mapsto \zeta_\sigma</mrow>
                                </md> 
                                is injective. It is not difficult to show, using the usual arguments, that <m>\phi</m> is a group homomorphism. Thus <m>G</m> is isomorphic to its image <m>\phi(G)\leq \mu_n</m>. Since <m>\mu_n</m> is cyclic of cardinality <m>n</m>, and since all subgroups of cyclic groups are cyclic, we conclude that <m>G\cong \phi(G)</m> is cyclic. Furthermore since <m>\phi(G)</m> is a subgroup of <m>\mu_n</m>, we have <m>\abs{G}\mid n</m>, and thus <m>[K\colon F]=\abs{G}</m> divides <m>n</m>.
