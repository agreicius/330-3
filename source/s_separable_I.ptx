        <statement>
            <p>
                Let <m>F</m> be a field. A nonconstant polynomial <m>f</m> is separable if and only if <m>f</m> and <m>f'</m> are relatively prime. Using logical shorthand: 
                <me>
                    f \text{ separable} \iff (f,f')=1
                </me>.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <proof>
            <p>
                We prove each implication separately. Let <m>\overline{F}/F</m> be an algebraic closure of <m>F</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For the forward direction, assume <m>f</m> is separable. We will show that <m>f</m> and <m>f'</m> have no common linear factor <m>(x-\alpha)</m> over <m>\overline{F}</m>, from whence it follows that they have no common nonconstant factor over <m>F</m>. To this end, suppose we have <m>f(x)=(x-\alpha)g(x)</m>. Since <m>f</m> is separable, the root <m>\alpha</m> is simple, and hence <m>(x-\alpha)\nmid g(x)</m>. But then we have 
                <me>
                    f'(x)=(x-\alpha)'g(x)+(x-\alpha)g'(x)=g(x)+(x-\alpha)g'(x),
                </me>
                in which case <m>f'(\alpha)=g(\alpha)+0=g(\alpha)\ne 0</m>, since <m>\alpha</m> is not a root of <m>g</m>. Thus <m>f</m> and <m>f'</m> have no common roots, and hence no common linear factor, as desired.   
            </p>
            <p>
                For the reverse implication, assume <m>f</m> and <m>f'</m> are relatively prime. Recall that this is equivalent to <m>(f,f')=(1)</m> as ideals in <m>F[x]</m>, in which case we have <m>1=g(x)f(x)+h(x)f'(x)</m> for some <m>g,h\in F[x]</m>. Suppose by contradiction that <m>f</m> is not separable, and that <m>\alpha</m> is a repeated root. We can factor <m>f</m> over <m>\overline{F}</m> as  <m>f(x)=(x-\alpha)^2g(x)</m> for some <m>g\in K[x]</m>, in which case 
                <me>
                    f'(x)=2(x-\alpha)g(x)+(x-\alpha)g'(x)=(x-\alpha)(2g(x)+g'(x)).
                </me>
                Thus <m>\alpha</m> is a common root of <m>f</m> and <m>f'</m> over <m>\overline{K}</m>. But this is a contradiction since then we'd have 
                <me>
                    1=g(\alpha)f(\alpha)+h(\alpha)f'(\alpha)=0+0=0
                </me>.
                 We conclude that <m>f</m> is separable, as desired.

                By <xref ref="th_sep_poly"/>, <m>f</m> is separable if and only if <m>(f,f')=1</m>; so it suffices to show that for an <em>irreducible</em> polynomial, <m>(f,f')=1</m> if and only if <m>f'\ne 0</m>.

            <p>
                Assume <m>f=\anpoly</m> is irreducible. Since <m>f'(x)=na_nx^{n-1}+\cdots 2a_2x+a_1</m>, we see that either <m>\deg f'&lt; \deg f</m>, or <m>f'=0</m>. Since the only factors of <m>f</m>, up to multiplication by units, are <m>f</m> and <m>1</m>, we see that <m>(f,f')=1</m> or <m>(f,f')=f</m>. Since <m>f'\ne 0</m> implies <m>\deg f'&lt; f</m>, we see that the second condition attains if and only if <m>f'=0</m>. Equivalently, <m>(f,f')=1</m> if and only if <m>f'=0</m>.
