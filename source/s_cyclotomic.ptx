				A <term>primitive <m>n</m>-th root of unity</term> is an element <m>\zeta\in \mu_n(\overline{F})</m> whose multiplicative order <m>\ord \zeta</m> is equal to <m>n</m>: <ie/>, <m>n</m> is the smallest positive integer such that <m>\zeta^n=1</m>.

		In this case, for all positive integers <m>n</m> the group <m>\mu_n=\mu_n(\Qbar)</m> is a cyclic subgroup of <m>\Qbar^*</m> of cardinality <m>n</m>, and in fact we have

		where <m>\zeta\in \Qbar</m> is any fixed primitive <m>n</m>-th root of unity.
		(We often take <m>\zeta=e^{2\pi i/n}\in \C</m>.) Furthermore, the other primitive <m>n</m>-th roots of unity are precisely the powers <m>\zeta^i</m>, where <m>1\leq i\leq n</m> and <m>(i,n)=1</m>.
		Thus, there are exactly <m>\phi(n)</m> distinct primitive <m>n</m>-th roots of unity, where <m>\phi</m> is the <xref ref="d_Euler_totient" text="title"/>.

		Looking at the cyclotomic polynomials in <xref ref="eg_cyc_polys"/>, we notice two things (beyond the fact that <m>\deg \Phi_n(x)=\phi(n)</m>): <m>\Phi_n(x)\in \Z[x]</m>, and <m>\Phi_n(x)</m> is irreducible over <m>\Q</m>.

	<p>
		<xref ref="th_cyc_polys"/> has some important consequences for cyclotomic field extensions of <m>\Q</m>. Let <m>\zeta\in \Qbar</m> be a primitive <m>n</m>-th root of unity for some positive integer <m>n</m>. The extension <m>K=\Q(\zeta)</m> is Galois over <m>\Q</m>, as it is the splitting field of <m>x^n-1</m>. (As usual, separability is automatic over a characteristic zero field.) Since <m>\zeta</m> is a root of <m>\Phi_n(x)</m>, which is irreducible by <xref ref="th_cyc_polys"/>, we have <m>m_{\zeta,\Q}(x)=\Phi_n(x)</m>. It follows that
		<me>
			[\Q(\zeta)\colon \Q]=\deg \Phi_n(x)=\phi(n)
		</me>.
		What can we say about the Galois group <m>G=\Gal(\Q(\zeta)/\Q)</m>? Recall that the group of units <m>(\Z/n\Z)^*</m> is of <m>\Z/m\Z</m> has cardinality <m>\abs{(\Z/n\Z)^*}=\phi(n)</m>.
		(See <xref ref="th_unit_groups"/>.) The following theorem should then come as no surprise.

				Let <m>n</m> be a positive integer.
				For any integer <m>j\in \Z</m>, we will write <m>\overline{j}</m> for its image <m>j+n\Z</m> in the quotient ring <m>\Z/n\Z</m>.
				Let <m>\zeta\in \Q</m> be a primitive <m>n</m>-th root of unity.

							<m>\Q(\zeta)/\Q</m> is a Galois extension of degree <m>\phi(n)</m>.
							
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							Let <m>G=\Gal(\Q(\zeta)/\Q)</m>. For any <m>\sigma\in G</m>, we have <m>\sigma(\zeta)=\zeta^{j}</m> for some integer <m>j</m> with <m>(j,n)=1</m>.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							Let <m>G=\Gal(\Q(\zeta)/\Q)</m>. The map <m>\phi\colon G\rightarrow (\Z/n\Z)^*</m> defined as
							<me>
								\phi(\sigma)=\overline{j}=j+n\Z

							is a group isomorphism.
							In particular, we have <m>G\cong (\Z/n\Z)^*</m>.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
		</statement>


		<proof>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							The paragraph preceding the the theorem statement proves that <m>\Q(\zeta)/\Q</m> is a Galois extension of degree <m>\phi(n)</m>.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							Given <m>\sigma\in G</m>, since <m>\sigma</m> is an automorphism it is easy to see that
							<me>
								\ord \sigma(\zeta)=\ord \zeta=n
							</me>.
							It follows that we have <m>\sigma(\zeta)=\zeta^j</m>, for some integer <m>j</m>, where <m>(j,n)=1</m>.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							Since <m>\zeta^j=\zeta^{j'}</m> if and only if <m>j\equiv j' \pmod n</m> if and only if <m>\overline{j}=\overline{j'}</m>, the map <m>\phi\colon G\rightarrow (\Z/n\Z)^*</m> is well defined.
                        </p>
                        <p>
							Suppose <m>\sigma,\tau\in G</m> satisfy 
                            <men xml:id="eq_cyc_ext">\sigma(\zeta)=\zeta^j, \tau(\zeta)=\zeta^{k}</men>.
                            We have
							<md>
								<mrow>\sigma=\tau \amp \iff \sigma(\zeta)=\tau(\zeta)</mrow>
								<mrow> \amp \iff \zeta^j=\zeta^{k} </mrow>
								<mrow> \amp \iff j\equiv k \pmod n</mrow>
								<mrow> \amp \iff \overline{j}=\overline{k}</mrow>
								<mrow> \amp \iff \phi(\sigma)=\phi(\tau)</mrow>
							</md>.
							This proves that <m>\phi</m> is injective.
							Similarly, given <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m> satisfying <xref ref="eq_cyc_ext"/>, we have
							<me>
								\sigma\tau(\zeta)=\sigma(\tau(\zeta))=\sigma(\zeta^k)=(\zeta^{k})^j=\zeta^{jk}
							</me>,
							in which case
							<md>
								<mrow>\phi(\sigma\tau) \amp = \overline{jk}</mrow>
								<mrow> \amp = \overline{j}\ \overline{k}</mrow>
								<mrow> \amp = \phi(\sigma)\phi(\tau)</mrow>
							</md>.
							Thus <m>\phi</m> is a group homomorphism.
							Lastly, since <m>\phi</m> is injective, and since <m>\abs{G}=\abs{(\Z/n\Z)^*}=\phi(n)</m>, we conclude that <m>\phi</m> is also surjective, and hence a group isomorphism.

        Thanks to <xref ref="th_cyc_ext"/> and our thorough understanding of the modular unit groups <m>(\Z/n\Z)^*</m> (see <xref ref="th_unit_groups"/>), the family of cyclotomic extensions of <m>\Q</m> furnish us with a wonderful testing ground for Galois theory. Note that since the Galois groups of a cyclotomic extension <m>\Q(\zeta)/\Q</m> are <em>abelian</em>, all subgroups are normal, and hence all subextensions of <m>\Q(\zeta)/\Q</m> are Galois. As such, cyclotomic examples are not particularly revealing with regard to the issue of normal versus non-normal subextensions. That said, they do give rise to interesting and computable lattices of subfields.

        Before getting into examples, we record some fascinating and useful properties of cyclotomic polynomials that allow us to compute their expanded form in a recursive manner.

        <proof>
            <p>
                Statement (1) was proved as part of the proof of <xref ref="th_cyc_polys"/>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The remaining statements can be proved using the following argument: if <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> are (a) monic, (b) separable, and (c) have the same degree, then <m>f=g</m> if and only if they have the same roots. Note that for all <m>n\in \Z_+</m>, since <m>\Phi_n(x)</m> is irreducible and <m>\character \Q=-</m>, <m>\Phi_n(x)</m> is separable. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, consider (2). First observe that since <m>n</m> is odd, we have <m>\phi(2n)=\phi(2)\phi(n)=\phi(n)</m>. Thus <m>\deg \Phi_{2n}(x)=\deg \Phi_n(-x)</m>. Furthermore, since <m>n&gt; 2</m>, <m>\phi(n)</m> is even. Thus <m>\Phi_n(-x)</m> is monic. Lastly, the roots of <m>\Phi_n(-x)</m> are precisely the negatives of the roots of <m>\Phi_n(x)</m>. Suppose <m>\zeta</m> is a primitive <m>n</m>-th root of unity. Since <m>n</m> is odd, we cannot have <m>\zeta^j=-1</m>. It follows that 
                <md>
                    <mrow>(-\zeta)^j=(-1)^j \zeta^j=1 \amp \iff j\text{ even and } \zeta^j=1 </mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp \iff 2\mid j \text{ and } n\mid j \amp (\ord \zeta=n)</mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp \iff 2n\mid j</mrow>
                </md>.
                This shows that <m>\ord(-\zeta)=2n</m>. We conclude that the <m>\phi(n)</m> roots of <m>\Phi_n(-x)</m> are precisely the distinct primitive <m>2n</m>-th roots of unity. It follows that both polynomials are separable, and we have  <m>\Phi_{2n}(x)=\Phi_n(-x)</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                The proofs of the rest of the statements are left as an exercise.
