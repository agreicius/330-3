    <title>Normal extensions</title>
    <p>
        In this section we will see that splitting field extensions <m>K/F</m> satisfy a special property with respect to extensions of field embeddings: one that will be especially important when studying Galois groups and their normal subgroups. In part because of this, these extensions will be called <term>normal</term>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Our first result, however, deals with algebraic extensions <m>K/F</m>, and assures us the existence of extensions of embeddings <m>\sigma\colon F\rightarrow L</m> into an algebraically closed field.  
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="th_emb_ext_alg">
        <title>Algebraic extensions of embeddings</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Let <m>K/F</m> be an algebraic extension. Given an embedding <m>\sigma\colon F\rightarrow L</m>, where <m>L</m> is an algebraically closed field, there is an extension <m>\tau</m> of <m>\sigma</m> to <m>K</m>.

    <p>
        We postpone the proof of this theorem to then end of the section, as it relies on a general version of Zorn's lemma. Two important consequences of <xref ref="th_emb_ext_alg"/> are that splitting fields of sets of polynomials and algebraic closures are unique up to isomorphism.

    <corollary xml:id="cor_">
        <title>Uniqueness of splitting fields</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Let <m>K/F</m> be a splitting field of a subset <m>\mathcal{P}\subseteq F[x]</m>
