		The main result of this section is <xref ref="th_finite_ext"/>, which both generalizes <xref ref="eg_finite_simple_alg"/> and gives a full characterization of finite extensions in terms of finitely generated and algebraic field extensions.
		First we treat the <xref ref="th_degree_towers" text="custom">tower law</xref>, which will be instrumental in proving <xref ref="th_finite_ext"/>, and is also quite useful in its own right.

			<title>Proof of (1)</title>
			<p>
				Let <m>B=\{\alpha\beta\colon \alpha\in B_1, \beta\in B_2\}</m>, as in the theorem statement. We will show directly that <m>B</m> is a basis of <m>L</m> as an <m>F</m>-vector space, by showing that it spans and is linearly independent. 
			</p>
			<case>
				<title><m>B</m> spans</title>
				<p>
				 Given any <m>\alpha\in L</m>, since <m>B_2</m> is a <m>K</m>-basis of <m>L</m>, we can write 
				 <me>
					\alpha=c_1\beta_1+c_2\beta_2+\cdots +c_n\beta_n=\sum_{j=1}^nc_j\beta_j
				 </me>
				 for some elements <m>\beta_j\in B_2</m> and scalars <m>c_j\in K</m>. Next since <m>B_1</m> is a basis of <m>K</m> over <m>F</m>, we can find a finite set <m>\{\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots, \alpha_m\}\subseteq B_1</m> such that for each <m>1\leq j\leq n</m> we have 
				 <me>
					c_j=d_{1j}\alpha_1+d_{2j}\alpha_2+\cdots +d_{mj}\alpha_m=\sum_{i=1}^md_{ij}\alpha_i
				 </me>
				 for some elements <m>d_{ij}\in F</m>. Substituting these expressions for <m>c_j</m> into the first linear combination above, we conclude that 
				 <md>
					<mrow> \alpha\amp = \sum_{j=1}^nc_j\beta_j </mrow>
					<mrow> \amp = \sum_{j=1}^n (\sum_{i=1}^md_{ij}\alpha_i)\beta_j</mrow>
					<mrow> \amp =\sum_{\substack{1\leq i\leq m\\ 1\leq j\leq n }}d_{ij}\, \alpha_i\, \beta_j </mrow>
				 </md>
				 for some scalars <m>d_{ij}\in F</m> and elements <m>\alpha_i\beta_j\in B</m>. 
				 This shows that every element of <m>L</m> can be written as a <m>F</m>-linear combination of elements of <m>B</m>, and hence that <m>\Span_F B=L</m>. 
				</p>
			</case>
			<case>
				<title><m>B</m> is linearly independent</title>
				<p>
					Assume we have an  <m>F</m>-linear combination 
					<me>
						\sum_{\substack{1\leq i\leq m\\ 1\leq j\leq n }}d_{ij}\alpha_i\, \beta_j=0
					</me>,
					where <m>\alpha_i\in B_1</m>, <m>\beta_j\in B_2</m>, <m>d_{ij}\in F</m> and the elements <m>\alpha_i\beta_j</m> are distinct. Grouping terms, we can re-write this as 
					<me>
						\sum_{j=1}^nc_j\beta_j=0
					</me>,
					where for each <m>1\leq j\leq n</m>, we have 
					<me>
						c_j=\sum_{i=1}^md_{ij}\alpha_j \in K
					</me>. 
					Firstly, since <m>\alpha_i\beta_j\ne \alpha_{i'}\beta_{j'}</m> for all <m>(i,j)\ne (i',j')</m>, it follows easily that <m>\beta_j\ne \beta_{j'}</m> for <m>j\ne j'</m>. Since <m>B_2</m> is linearly independent over <m>K</m>, we conclude that <m>c_j=0</m> for all <m>1\leq j\leq n</m>. But then, since <m>B_1</m> is linearly independent over <m>F</m>, for all <m>1\leq j\leq n</m> we have  
					<me>
						c_j=\sum_{i=1}^md_{ij}\alpha_j=0\implies d_{ij}=0 \text{ for all } 1\leq i\leq m
					</me>.
					We conclude that <m>d_{ij}=0</m> for all <m>1\leq i\leq m</m> and <m>1\leq j\leq n</m>. 
					This proves <m>B</m> is linearly independent over <m>F</m>.

		<proof>
			<title>Proof of (2)</title>
			<p>
				We treat two cases: (a) <m>K/F</m> and <m>L/K</m> are both finite extensions, and (b) at least one of <m>K/F</m> and <m>L/K</m> is an infinite extension.  
			</p>
			<case>
			<title>Case (a)</title>
			<p>
			Assume <m>[K\colon F]=n_1</m> and <m>[L\colon K]=n_2</m>, for positive integers <m>n_1, n_2</m>. By definition we can find bases 
			<md>
				<mrow>B_1 \amp =\{\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots, \alpha_{n_1}\}</mrow>
				<mrow>B_2 \amp =\{\beta_1,\beta_2,\dots, \beta_{n_2}\}</mrow>
			</md>
			for <m>K</m> as an <m>F</m>-vector space, and <m>L</m> as a <m>K</m>-vector space, respectively. By statement (1) of this theorem, we conclude that 
			<me>
				B=\{\alpha_i\beta_j\colon 1\leq i\leq n_1, 1\leq j\leq n_2\}
			</me>
			is a basis of <m>L</m> as an <m>F</m>-vector space. It remains only to show that <m>\abs{B}=n_1n_2</m>, since then we have 
			<me>
				[L\colon F]=\dim_F L=\abs{B}=n_1n_2=[K\colon F][L\colon K]=[L\colon K][K\colon F]
			</me>.
			To see that <m>\abs{B}=n_1n_2</m>, we show that the map 
			<md>
				<mrow>B_1\times B_2 \amp \rightarrow B</mrow>
				<mrow>(\alpha, \beta) \amp \mapsto \alpha\beta</mrow>
			</md>
			is a bijection, whence <m>\abs{B}=\abs{B_1}\times \abs{B_2}=n_1n_2</m>. The map is surjective by definition of <m>B</m>. That the map is injective follows from the following chain of implications: 
			<md>
				<mrow> \alpha\beta=\alpha'\beta' \amp \implies \alpha\beta-\alpha'\beta' </mrow>
				<mrow> \amp \implies \beta=\beta' \text{ or } \alpha=\alpha'=0 \amp (B_2 \text{ lin. ind. over } K) </mrow>
				<mrow> \amp\implies \beta=\beta' \amp (B_1 \text{ basis } \implies \alpha\ne 0, \alpha'\ne 0) </mrow>
				<mrow> \amp \implies \alpha=\alpha' \text{ and } \beta=\beta' \amp (\alpha\beta=\alpha'\beta')</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp \implies (\alpha, \beta)=(\alpha', \beta')</mrow>
			</md>.
			</p>
			</case>
			<case>
			<title>Case (b)</title>
			<p>
				Assume first that <m>K/F</m> is infinite. In this case we can find an infinite set <m>S</m> of the form <m>S=\{\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots,\}\subseteq K</m> that is linearly independent over <m>F</m>. But <m>S</m> is also a subset of <m>L</m>, and thus <m>L/F</m> has an infinite linearly independent set, making it an infinite extension. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Now assume that <m>L/K</m> is infinite. In this case we can find an infinite set <m>S</m> of the form <m>S=\{\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots,\}\subseteq L</m> that is linearly independent over <m>K</m>. But then <m>S</m> is also linearly independent over the smaller field <m>F</m>, since an <m>F</m>-linear combination of elements of <m>S</m> is also a <m>K</m>-linear combination. Thus <m>L/F</m> also has infinite dimension.

		<title>Tower law</title>
		<p>
			Statement (1) of <xref ref="th_degree_towers"/> is just as important as (2), as it gives us a procedure for building a basis for <m>L/F</m> from bases <m>B_1</m> of <m>L/K</m> and <m>B_2</m> of <m>K/F</m>: namely, we simply take the set of all products of elements in <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m>.

	<remark>
		<title>Tower law: infinite extensions</title>
		<p>
			The formula <xref ref="eq_degree_towers_formula"/> is true even when one or more of the field extensions involved is infinite, using the following rules from <q>extended arithmetic</q>:
			<md>
				<mrow>\infty \amp = n\cdot \infty=\infty\cdot n=\infty\cdot \infty \text{ for all positive } n\in \Z </mrow>
				<mrow>\infty \amp\ne m\cdot n \text{ for all positive }  m,n \in \Z  </mrow>
			</md>.
			Equivalently, we can interpret <xref ref="eq_degree_towers_formula"/> as stating that the extension <m>L/F</m> is infinite if and only if <m>L/K</m> is infinite or <m>K/F</m> is infinite.

				<mrow>K/F \text{ finite} \amp\implies K/F \text{ algebraic} </mrow>

				The implication (1)<m>\implies</m>(2) is clear, since if <m>K/F</m> is algebraic, then we have <m>K=F(K)</m> and all elements of <m>K</m> are algebraic over <m>F</m>.
			</p>
			<p>
				We now prove the implication (2)<m>\implies</m> (1). Assume <m>K=F(A)</m>, where <m>A</m> is a set of algebraic elements of <m>K</m>. Since by <xref ref="th_fin_gen"/> we have 
				<me>
					K=\bigcup_{\substack{A'\subseteq A\\ A' \text{ finite}}}F(A')
				</me>,
				given any <m>\beta\in K</m>, we have 
				<me>
					\beta\in F(A')=F(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots, \alpha_m)
				</me>
				for some <m>A'=\{\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots, \alpha_m\}\subseteq A</m>. Since each <m>\alpha_i</m> is algebraic, <m>F(A')</m> is finite over <m>F</m>, hence algebraic over <m>F</m> by <xref ref="th_finite_ext"/>. We conclude that <m>\beta</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>, as desired.

        <p>
            The field <m>\overline{F}_K</m> is called the <em>relative</em> algebraic closure of <m>F</m>, since it depends on <m>K</m>. Later we will define the plain old algebraic closure of <m>F</m>, denoted <m>\overline{F}</m>, which (up to isomorphism) depends only on <m>F</m>.

    <example>
        <title>Relative algebraic closure</title>
        <p>
            Let's consider some relative algebraic closures of <m>\Q</m>.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Let <m>K=\Q</m>. Clearly the algebraic closure of <m>\Q</m> in <m>\Q</m> is <m>\Q</m>: that is, <m>\overline{\Q}_K=\Q</m>. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Let <m>K=\Q(\pi)</m>. As you will show in homework, every element of <m>K-\Q</m> is transcendental. Thus <m>\overline{\Q}_K=\Q</m> in this case as well. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, consider <m>\C/\Q</m> and the relative algebraic closure <m>\overline{\Q}_\C</m>. By the fundamental theorem of algebra, given any rational polynomial <m>f(x)\in \Q[x]</m>, we can factor <m>f(x)</m> over <m>\C</m> as 
                        <me>
                            f(x)=a(x-\alpha_1)(x-\alpha_2)\cdots (x-\alpha_n), a\in \Q, \alpha_k\in \C
                        </me>.
                        For all <m>1\leq k\leq n</m>, since <m>\alpha_k</m> is a root of <m>f</m>, it is algebraic, and hence is an element of <m>\overline{\Q}_\C</m>. It follows that in fact every rational polynomial <m>f(x)\in \Q[x]</m> can be factored into linear terms over the field <m>\overline{\Q}_\C</m>. The field <m>\overline{\Q}_\C</m> is a good deal more manageable than <m>\C</m> in that it is (a) algebraic over <m>\Q</m>, and (b) is countable (as opposed to uncountable), as one can show along the lines of <xref ref="eg_trans_uncount"/>.
