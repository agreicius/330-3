              Let <m>K/F</m> be a field extension. We say <m>K</m> is <term>algebraic</term> over <m>F</m> if all elements of <m>K</m> are algebraic over <m>F</m>.

        <p>
            The extension <m>\R/\Q</m> is not algebraic, since <m>\pi\in \R</m> is transcendental over <m>\Q</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The extension <m>\C/\R</m> is algebraic. As we have shown previously, any element <m>a+bi\in \C</m> satisfies the quadratic polynomial <m>x^2+2ax+(a^2+b^2)</m>.

                According to <xref ref="th_simple_ext"/>, we have <m>\dim_F K=[K:F]=n</m> for some finite <m>n</m>. It follows that given any <m>\beta\in K</m>, the set <m>\{\beta^n,\beta^{n-1},\dots, \beta, 1\}</m> is linearly dependent, since it has more than <m>n</m> elements (<xref ref="th_dimension_compendium" text="global"/>,<q>street smarts</q>). Thus there is a nontrivial linear combination 
            <me>
                a_n\beta^n+a_{n-1}\beta^{n-1}+\cdots +a_1\beta+a_0=0
            </me>.
            In other words, we have <m>f(\beta)=0</m>, where <m>f(x)=\anpoly</m>. This proves <m>\beta</m> is algebraic, as desired.

        The main result of this section is <xref ref="th_finite_ext"/>, which both generalizes <xref ref="eg_finite_simple_alg"/> and gives a full characterization of finite extensions in terms of finitely generated and algebraic field extensions. First we treat the  <em>degree in towers theorem</em>, which will be instrumental in proving <xref ref="th_finite_ext"/>, and is also quite useful in its own right.

                Let <m>L/K/F</m> be a tower of field extensions. 
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            If <m>B_1</m> is a basis of <m>K</m> and <m>B_2</m> is a basis of <m>L</m> as a <m>K</m>-vector space, then the set 
                            <men xml:id="eq_degree_towers_basis">
                                B=\{\alpha\cdot \beta\colon \alpha\in B_1, \beta\in B_2\}

                            is a basis of <m>L</m> as an <m>F</m>-vector space.

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            We have 
                            <men xml:id="eq_degree_towers_formula">
                                [L\colon F]=[L\colon K][K\colon F]
                            </men>. 
                            The formula is true even when one or more of the field extensions involved is infinite, using the following rules from <q>extended arithmetic</q>:
                            <md>
                                <mrow>\infty \amp = n\cdot \infty=\infty\cdot n=\infty\cdot \infty \text{ for all positive } n\in \Z </mrow>
                                <mrow>\infty \amp\ne m\cdot n \text{ for all positive }  m,n \in \Z  </mrow>
                            </md>.
                            Alternatively, in this case we interpret <xref ref="eq_degree_towers_formula"/> as stating that the extension <m>L/F</m> is infinite if and only if <m>L/K</m> is infinite or <m>K/F</m>.

        <title>Degree in towers</title>
        <p>
            Statment (1) of <xref ref="th_degree_towers"/> is just as important as (2), as it gives us a procedure for building a basis for <m>L/F</m> from bases <m>B_1</m> of <m>L/K</m> and <m>B_2</m> of <m>K/F</m>: namely, we simply take the set of all products of elements in <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m>.
