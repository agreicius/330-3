		<statement>
			<p>
				Let <m>K/F</m> be a field extension.
				We say <m>K</m> is <term>algebraic</term> over <m>F</m> if all elements of <m>K</m> are algebraic over <m>F</m>.

	<example xml:id="eg_alg_ext">
		<title>Algebraic extensions</title>
		<p>
			The extension <m>\R/\Q</m> is not algebraic, since <m>\pi\in \R</m> is transcendental over <m>\Q</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			The extension <m>\C/\R</m> is algebraic.
			As we have shown previously, any element <m>a+bi\in \C</m> satisfies the quadratic polynomial <m>x^2+2ax+(a^2+b^2)</m>.

	<example xml:id="eg_finite_simple_alg">
		<title>Simple extension with algebraic generator</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Let <m>K=F(\alpha)</m>, where <m>\alpha</m> is algebraic.
				Prove that <m>K</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>.
			</p>
		</statement>

		<solution>
			<p>
				According to <xref ref="th_simple_ext"/>, we have <m>\dim_F K=[K:F]=n</m> for some finite <m>n</m>.
				It follows that given any <m>\beta\in K</m>, the set <m>\{\beta^n,\beta^{n-1},\dots, \beta, 1\}</m> is linearly dependent, since it has more than <m>n</m> elements (<xref ref="th_dimension_compendium" text="global"/>,<q>street smarts</q>).
				Thus there is a nontrivial linear combination
				<me>
					a_n\beta^n+a_{n-1}\beta^{n-1}+\cdots +a_1\beta+a_0=0
				</me>.
				In other words, we have <m>f(\beta)=0</m>, where <m>f(x)=\anpoly</m>.
				This proves <m>\beta</m> is algebraic, as desired.

		The main result of this section is <xref ref="th_finite_ext"/>, which both generalizes <xref ref="eg_finite_simple_alg"/> and gives a full characterization of finite extensions in terms of finitely generated and algebraic field extensions.
		First we treat the <xref ref="th_degree_towers" text="custom">tower law</xref>, which will be instrumental in proving <xref ref="th_finite_ext"/>, and is also quite useful in its own right.

		<title>Tower law</title>
		<p>
			Statement (1) of <xref ref="th_degree_towers"/> is just as important as (2), as it gives us a procedure for building a basis for <m>L/F</m> from bases <m>B_1</m> of <m>L/K</m> and <m>B_2</m> of <m>K/F</m>: namely, we simply take the set of all products of elements in <m>B_1</m> and <m>B_2</m>.

	<remark>
		<title>Tower law: infinite extensions</title>
		<p>
			The formula <xref ref="eq_degree_towers_formula"/> is true even when one or more of the field extensions involved is infinite, using the following rules from <q>extended arithmetic</q>:
			<md>
				<mrow>\infty \amp = n\cdot \infty=\infty\cdot n=\infty\cdot \infty \text{ for all positive } n\in \Z </mrow>
				<mrow>\infty \amp\ne m\cdot n \text{ for all positive }  m,n \in \Z  </mrow>
			</md>.
			Equivalently, we can interpret <xref ref="eq_degree_towers_formula"/> as stating that the extension <m>L/F</m> is infinite if and only if <m>L/K</m> is infinite or <m>K/F</m>.

        <p>
            As we saw in the proof of <xref ref="th_finite_ext"/>, given a field extension <m>K/F</m> the following implications hold:
            <md>
                <mrow>K/F \text{ finite} \amp\implies K/F \text{ finitely generated} </mrow>
                <mrow>K/F \text{ finite} \amp\implies K/F \text{ algebraic} </mrow>
            </md>.
            On the other hand, neither of these implications goes the other way. That is, we have 
            <md>
                <mrow>K/F \text{ finite } \hspace{5pt} \amp\not\!\!\!\!\!\!\impliedby K/F \text{ finitely generated} </mrow>
                <mrow>K/F \text{ finite } \hspace{5pt} \amp\not\!\!\!\!\!\!\impliedby K/F \text{ algebraic} </mrow>
            </md>.
            In other words, taken singly, neither of these two properties (finitely generated, algebraic) is strong enough to imply the property of being finite. <xref ref="th_finite_ext"/> tells us that the two properties taken together are in fact equivalent to being finite: <ie/>, 
            <me>
                K/F \text{ finite } \iff K/F \text{ finitely generated and algebraic}
            </me>.
