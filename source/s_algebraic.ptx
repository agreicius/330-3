	<title>Algebraic extensions: definition</title>
	<p>
        In this section we be begin to investigate in earnest the concept of an element (and a field extension) being <xref ref="d_algebraic" text="custom">algebraic</xref>. (In fact, the focus of the course from here on out will be more on algebraic elements, and less on transcendental elements.) An essential tool in our investigation will be the notion of the <em>minimal polynomial</em> of an algebraic element.  
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="th_min_poly">
		<title>Minimal polynomial</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Let <m>K/F</m> be a field extension, let <m>\alpha\in K</m> be algebraic, and let <m>\phi\colon F[x]\rightarrow K</m> be the evaluation at <m>\alpha</m> map.
				There is a unique polynomial <m>f(x)=x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots +a_1x+a_0</m> satisfying the following equivalent conditions.
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							<m>f(x)</m> is monic and satisfies <m>\ker \phi=(f)</m>.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							<m>f(x)</m> is a monic polynomial of minimal degree satisfying <m>f(\alpha)=0</m>.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							<m>f(x)</m> is a monic irreducible polynomial satisfying <m>f(\alpha)=0</m>.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
		</statement>
		
		<proof>
			<p>
				Let <m>\phi\colon F[x]\rightarrow K</m> be the evaluation at <m>\alpha</m> map.
				Since <m>\alpha</m> is algebraic, according to <xref ref="th_simple_ext"/> <m>\ker\phi</m> is nonzero and generated by an irreducible polynomial.
				Although the generator of <m>\ker\phi</m> is not in general unique, there is a unique <em>monic</em> irreducible generator <m>f(x)</m>.
				This gives us the unique existence of a polynomial as described in (1).
			</p>

			<p>
				Continue to assume that <m>f</m> is the unique monic generator of <m>\ker \phi</m>.
				The equivalence of conditions (1)-(3) follows from the following observations:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Since <m>\ker\phi</m> is a nonzero prime ideal, any generator of it must be irreducible.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							A polynomial <m>g\in \ker \phi</m> if and only if <m>g(\alpha)=0</m>.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							In general for a nonzero ideal <m>I\leq F[x]</m>, we have <m>I=(g)</m> if and only if <m>g</m> is an element of <m>I</m> of minimal degree.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							Since in this case <m>\ker \phi</m> is a nonzero prime ideal, we have <m>I=(g)</m> if and only if <m>g</m> is an irreducible element of <m>\ker \phi</m>.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

			<p>
				Let <m>K/F</m> be a field extension, and let <m>\alpha\in K</m> be algebraic.
				The unique monic polynomial satisfying the three equivalent conditions of <xref ref="th_min_poly"/> is called the <term>minimal polynomial</term> (or <term>irreducible polynomial</term>) of <m>\alpha</m> over <m>F</m>, and is denoted <m>m_{\alpha, F}(x)</m>, or just <m>m_\alpha(x)</m> if the base field <m>F</m> is understood.

			<p>
				The <term>degree</term> of the algebraic element <m>\alpha</m> over <m>F</m>, denoted <m>\deg_F \alpha</m>, is defined as the degree of the minimal polynomial of <m>\alpha</m>: <ie/>, <m>\deg_F\alpha=\deg m_{\alpha, F}(x)</m>.

		<title>Minimal polynomials for <m>\C/\R</m></title>
		<p>
			Consider the field extension <m>\C/\R</m> and the element <m>i\in \C</m>.

<theorem xml:id="th_finite_implies_algebraic">

        <p>
            Let <m>K/F</m> be a field extension. If <m>K/F</m> is finite, then <m>K/F</m> is algebraic. Using logical shorthand, we have

            The proof is essentially the same argument used in <xref ref="eg_finite_simple_alg"/>. We repeat it nonetheless.

            where <m>a_i\in F</m> for all <m>0\leq i\leq n+1</m>. It follows that the <m>F</m>-polynomial <m>f(x)=a_{n+1}x^{n+1}+a_nx^n+\cdots +a_1x+a_0</m> is nonzero and satisfies <m>f(\beta=0</m>.

</theorem>
<p>
    Assume <m>K/F</m> is algebraic. It is not true in general that <m>K/F</m> is finite: that is,  the converse of <xref ref="eq_finite_algebraic"/> is not true. <xref ref="th_finite_ext"/>, which we will prove in the next section, identifies an additional property <m>K/F</m> needs to satisfy in order to be finite: namely, it must be <em>finitely generated</em>.  By the end of that section, we will also be able to provide an example of a field extension that is algebraic but not finite.
