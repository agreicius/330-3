			Let <m>F</m> be a field.
			In order to speak of a field of the form <m>K=F(\alpha)</m> or <m>K=F(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots, \alpha_n)</m>, we technically need to introduce a larger <q>ambient</q> field <m>L/F</m> where these elements <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\alpha_i</m> are drawn from.

			In situations where this ambient field <m>L</m> does not play an important role, we reserve the right to omit it from our discussion.
			For example, if introducing a simple field extension <m>F(\alpha)/F</m> without further details, it is assumed that in fact <m>F\leq F(\alpha)\leq L</m> for some larger field <m>L</m>.

			</p>
		</statement>

		<solution>
			<p>
				Denote <m>\F_2=\{0,1\}</m>.
				Since <m>\deg f=2</m>, it is irreducible over <m>\F_2</m> if and only if it has a root in <m>\F_2</m>.
				Since <m>f(0)=f(1)=1\ne 0 </m>, we see that <m>f</m> is irreducible.
				Using <xref ref="cor_quot_poly"/>, we conclude that <m>K=\F_2[x]/(f)</m> is  field, and that <m>B=\{\overline{x}, 1\}</m> is a basis of <m>K</m> over <m>\F_2</m>.

				Furthermore, since <m>K</m> is a field, the map <m>\phi</m> is injective, and thus we have <m>K\cong \phi(K)\leq \C</m>.
				We claim <m>\phi(K)=\C</m>.

				It then follows that <m>K\cong \phi(K)</m> as <m>\R</m>-vector spaces, and thus that <m>\dim_\R \phi(K)=2</m>.

                First we show that the set <m>\Q[x]</m> is countable.
                This is because <m>\Q[x]=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty P_n</m>, where <m>P_n</m> is the set of all rational polynomials of degree at most <m>n</m>.
                Each set <m>P_n</m> is countable (<m>P_n</m> is in bijection with <m>\Q^n</m>, which is countable), and thus <m>\Q[x]</m>, being a countable union of countable sets, is countable.
                Lastly, we have

		<proof>
			<p>
				The key to proving both statements of the theorem is to understand the <q>evaluation at <m>\alpha</m></q> ring homomorphism
				<md>
					<mrow>\phi \colon F[x] \amp \rightarrow K</mrow>
					<mrow>f(x) \amp \mapsto f(\alpha)</mrow>
				</md>.
				Note first that we have
				<me>
					\phi(F[x])\cong F[x]/\ker \phi
				</me>,
				which implies <m>\ker \phi</m> is a prime ideal of <m>F[x]</m> (since <m>\phi(F[x])\leq K</m> is an integral domain).
				It follows that <m>\ker\phi=(0)</m> or <m>\ker \phi=(f)</m> for some irreducible polynomial <m>f\in F[x]</m>.
				Furthermore, since
				<me>
					\ker\phi=\{f\in F[x]\colon f(\alpha)=0\}
				</me>.
				we see immediately that the element <m>\alpha</m> is transcendental if and only if <m>\ker\phi=(0)</m> if and only if <m>\phi</m> is injective.
				Similarly, <m>\alpha</m> is algebraic if and only if <m>\ker \phi=(f)</m> for some irreducible polynomial <m>f</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Lastly, observe that
				<me>
					\phi(F[x])=\{\phi(f)\colon f\in F[x]\}=\{f(\alpha)\colon f(x)\in F[x]\}=F[\alpha]
				</me>,
				the subring of <m>K</m> generated over <m>F</m> by <m>\alpha</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Having given a rather thorough analysis of <m>\phi</m> we are ready to prove statements (1) and (2).
			</p>


			<proof>
				<title>Proof of (1)</title>
				<p>
					We have
					<md>
						<mrow>\alpha \text{ algebraic} \amp  \iff \phi(F[x])\cong F[x]/(f) \text{ for some irreducible } f</mrow>
						<mrow> \amp \iff F[\alpha]=\phi(F[x])\cong F[x]/(f) \text{ for some irreducible } f</mrow>
						<mrow> \amp \iff F[\alpha]=F(\alpha)\cong F[x]/(f)  \text{ for some irreducible } f</mrow>
					</md>,
					where the last equivalence uses the fact that <m>F[\alpha]=F(\alpha)</m> if and only if <m>F[\alpha]</m> is a field.
					(<xref ref="th_gen_ring_field"/>) This proves (i)<m>\iff</m>(ii).
				</p>

				<p>
					Next, (ii)<m>\implies</m>(iii) since if <m>f</m> is irreducible, the quotient <m>F[x]/(f)</m> is a finite field extension of <m>F</m> of degree <m>n=\deg f</m>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Lastly (iii)<m>\implies</m>(i) since if <m>\dim_F F(\alpha)=n</m>, then the set <m>\{\alpha^n, \alpha^{n-1},\dots, \alpha, 1\}</m> must be linearly dependent, in which case there is a nontrivial linear combination
					<me>
						a_n\alpha^{n}+a_{n-1}\alpha^{n-1}+\cdots +a_1\alpha+a_0=0
					</me>.
					But then we have <m>f(\alpha)=0</m>, where <m>f</m> is the nonzero polynomial <m>f(x)=\anpoly</m>.
					Thus <m>\alpha</m> is algebraic, as desired.
				</p>
			</proof>


			<proof>
				<title>Proof of (2)</title>
				<p>
					First observe that the equivalence (i)<m>\iff</m>(iii) follows from (1) above simply by taking negations.
					Furthermore, we have (ii)<m>\implies</m>(iii) since <m>[F(x)\colon F]=\infty</m>, as we saw in <xref ref="eg_simple"/>.
					Thus it remains only to show (i)<m>\implies</m>(ii).
				</p>

				<p>
					Assume <m>\alpha</m> is transcendental.
					We saw above that this is equivalent to our evaluation map <m>\phi</m> being injective.
					Thus we have <m>F[\alpha]=\phi(F[x])\cong F[x]</m>.
					Since <m>F(x)=\Frac F[x]</m>, we may use <xref ref="th_frac_field_universal"/> to get an injective map
					<md>
						<mrow>\widetilde{\phi}\colon F(x) \amp \rightarrow K</mrow>
						<mrow>f(x)/g(x) \amp \mapsto f(\alpha)/g(\alpha)</mrow>
					</md>.
					Thus <m>\widetilde{\phi}(F(x))</m> is a subfield of <m>K</m> containing <m>F</m> and <m>\alpha</m>.
					Since in turn any field containing <m>F</m> and <m>\alpha</m> must also contain all elements of the form <m>f(\alpha)/g(\alpha)</m>, where <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are polynomials, we see that <m>\widetilde{\phi}(F(x))</m> in fact the smallest such field: <ie/>, we have <m>F(\alpha)=\widetilde{\phi}(F(x))\cong F(x)</m>, as desired.

		<proof>
			<p>
				Let <m>\phi\colon F[x]\rightarrow K</m> be the evaluation at <m>\alpha</m> map.
				Since <m>\alpha</m> is algebraic, according to <xref ref="th_simple_ext"/> <m>\ker\phi</m> is nonzero and generated by an irreducible polynomial.
				Although the generator of <m>\ker\phi</m> is not in general unique, there is a unique <em>monic</em> irreducible generator <m>f(x)</m>.
				This gives us the unique existence of a polynomial as described in (1).
			</p>

			<p>
				Continue to assume that <m>f</m> is the unique monic generator of <m>\ker \phi</m>.
				The equivalence of conditions (1)-(3) follows from the following observations:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Since <m>\ker\phi</m> is a nonzero prime ideal, any generator of it must be irreducible.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							A polynomial <m>g\in \ker \phi</m> if and only if <m>g(\alpha)=0</m>.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							In general for a nonzero ideal <m>I\leq F[x]</m>, we have <m>I=(g)</m> if and only if <m>g</m> is an element of <m>I</m> of minimal degree.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>
							Since in this case <m>\ker \phi</m> is a nonzero prime ideal, we have <m>I=(g)</m> if and only if <m>g</m> is an irreducible element of <m>\ker \phi</m>.
