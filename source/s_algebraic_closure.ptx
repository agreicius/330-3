            It is easy to see that a field <m>F</m> is algebraically closed if and only if all nonconstant polynomials <m>f\in F[x]</m> have a root in <m>F</m>.

        <title>Algebraically closed and algebraic closure</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Let <m>K/F</m> be a field extension and assume <m>K</m> is algebraically closed. The relative algebraic closure <m>\overline{F}_K</m> of <m>F</m> in <m>K</m> is an algebraic closure of <m>F</m>. 
            </p>
        </statement>
        <proof>
            <p>
                We know from <xref ref="cor_rel_alg_closure"/> that <m>\overline{F}_K</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>; we must prove it is algebraically closed. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Let <m>f(x)\in \overline{F}_K[x]</m> be a nonconstant polynomial. Since <m>K</m> is algebraically closed and <m>f(x)\in \overline{F}_K[x]\subseteq K[x]</m>, there is an element <m>\alpha\in K</m> such that <m>f(\alpha)=0</m>: <ie/>, <m>f</m> has a root in <m>K</m>. Since <m>f(\alpha)=0</m>, we see that <m>\alpha</m> is algebraic over <m>\overline{F}_K</m>; it follows from <xref ref="cor_algebraic_algebraic_generated"/> that <m>\overline{F}_K(\alpha)</m> is algebraic over <m>\overline{F}_K</m>. Since <m>\overline{F}_K</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>, it follows from <xref ref="cor_alg_transitive"/> that <m>\overline{F}_K(\alpha)</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>. Thus <m>\alpha</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>, in which case <m>\alpha\in \overline{F}_K</m> by definition. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We have shown that any nonconstant polynomial <m>f\in \overline{F}_K[x]</m> has a root in <m>\overline{F}_K</m>. We conclude (using <xref ref="rm_alg_closed"/>) that <m>\overline{F}_K</m> is algebraically closed, as desired.

                Given any field <m>F</m>, there is an algebraic closure <m>K/F</m>.

        </statement>
        <proof>
            <p>
                Fix a field <m>F</m>. Our proof will make use of the polynomial ring
                <me>
                    R=F[\{ t_{f,j}\}]
                </me>
                 in infinitely many variables <m>t_{f,j}</m>, where <m>f\in F[x]</m> is a nonconstant polynomial, and <m>1\leq j\leq \deg f</m>. In other words, each pair <m>(f,j)</m>, where <m>f</m> is a nonconstant polynomial and <m>j</m> is a positive integer bounded by <m>\deg f</m>, is associated with a unique variable <m>t_{f,j}</m>. Without getting too technical, the polynomial ring <m>F[\{t_{f,j}\}]</m> is defined as the set of all <em>finite</em> polynomial combinations of the infinite variable set <m>\{t_{f,j}\colon f\in F[x]-F, 1\leq j\leq \deg f\}</m>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Next we will define an ideal <m>I</m> of <m>R</m>. For each monic nonconstant polynomial <m>f\in F[x]</m>, let 
                <mdn>
                    <mrow> g_f(x)\amp =f(x)-\prod_{j=1}^{n=\deg f}(x-t_{f,j}) </mrow>

                </mdn>.
                Observe that the coefficients <m>g_{f,j}</m> here are polynomials in the variables <m>\{t_{f,1},t_{f,2},\dots ,t_{f,n}\}</m>. With this notation in place we define <m>I</m> to be the ideal generated by the polynomials <m>g_{f,t}\in R</m>: <ie/>, 
                <me>
                    I=(\{g_{f,j}\colon f\in F[x]-F \text{ monic }, 1\leq j\leq \deg f\})
                </me>.
                Having assembled all the necessary ingredients, the rest of the proof proceeds as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Show that <m>I\ne R</m>, and thus is contained in a maximal ideal <m>\mathfrak{m}\leq R </m>.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Show that the field <m>K=R/\mathfrak{m}</m> is an algebraic extension of <m>F</m> that splits <m>F[x]</m>.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                Once we have shown (2), we conclude from <xref ref="cor_alg_closed_closure"/> that <m>K/F</m> is an algebraic closure.

                        Since <m>I\ne R</m>, there is a maximal ideal <m>\mathfrak{m}\supseteq I</m>. Let <m>K=R/\mathfrak{m}</m>.  As usual, the resriction to <m>F</m> of the quotient map <m>R\rightarrow R/\mathfrak{m}</m> is injective, and we identify <m>F</m> with its isomorphic image in <m>K=R/\mathfrak{m}</m>.

Clearly it suffices to show that <m>K</m> splits all nonconstant <em>monic</em> polynomials <m>f\in F[x]</m>. To see why this is true, first observe that the quotient map <m>\pi\colon R\rightarrow R/\mathfrak{m}</m> extends to a map of polynomial rings

                        since by definition of <m>I</m> we have <m>g_{f,j}\in I\leq \mathfrak{m}</m> and thus <m>\overline{g_{f,j}}=0\in K=R/\mathfrak{m}</m>. It follows that

                        Lastly, we show that <m>K=R/\mathfrak{m}</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>. Since <m>R</m> is generated as a ring over <m>F</m> by the <m>t_{f,j}</m>, <m>R/\mathfrak{m}</m> is generated as a ring over <m>F</m> by the images <m>\overline{t_{f,j}}</m>. It follows that <m>K</m> is generated as a field over <m>F</m> by the <m>\overline{t_{f,j}}</m>: <ie/>, <m>K=F(\{\overline{t_{f,j}})</m>. We saw above that <m>\overline{t_{f,j}}</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>f\in F[x]-F</m>. Thus each <m>\overline{t_{f,j}}</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>. But then <m>K=F(\{\overline{t_{f,j}})</m> is algebraically generated over <m>F</m>, and hence algebraic by <xref ref="cor_algebraic_algebraic_generated"/>.

        As we will see later, an algebraic closure of <m>F</m> is unique <em>up to isomorphism</em>. As such, we will often take liberties and speak of <q>the</q> algebraic closure of <m>F</m>, and will denote this as <m>\overline{F}</m>.

                Let <m>F</m> be a field. Given any set <m>\mathcal{P}\subseteq F[x]</m>, there is a splitting field <m>K/F</m> of <m>\mathcal{P}</m>.

        <proof>
            <p>
                Let <m>\Fbar/F</m> be an algebraic closure of <m>F</m>. Since <m>\Fbar</m> splits <m>\mathcal{P}</m>, <xref ref="th_split_to_splitting_field"/> tells us that the field <m>K=F(A)</m> is a splitting field of <m>\mathcal{P}</m>, where

                    A=\{\alpha\in \Fbar\colon f(\alpha)=0 \text{ for some } f\in \mathcal{P}\}
