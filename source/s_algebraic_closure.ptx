        An <em>algebraic closure</em> of a field is in a sense an absolute version of the notion of <xref ref="d_rel_alg_closure" text="custom">relative algebraic closure</xref> introduced in <xref ref="s_algebraic"/>.

            It is easy to see that a field <m>F</m> is algebraically closed if and only if all nonconstant polynomials <m>f\in F[x]</m> have a root in <m>F</m>.

        <statement>
            <p>
                Let <m>K/F</m> be a field extension and assume <m>K</m> is algebraically closed. The relative algebraic closure <m>\overline{F}_K</m> of <m>F</m> in <m>K</m> is an algebraic closure of <m>F</m>. 
            </p>
        </statement>
        <proof>
            <p>
                We know from <xref ref="cor_rel_alg_closure"/> that <m>\overline{F}_K</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>; we must prove it is algebraically closed. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Let <m>f(x)\in \overline{F}_K[x]</m> be a nonconstant polynomial. Since <m>K</m> is algebraically closed and <m>f(x)\in \overline{F}_K[x]\subseteq K[x]</m>, there is an element <m>\alpha\in K</m> such that <m>f(\alpha)=0</m>: <ie/>, <m>f</m> has a root in <m>K</m>. Since <m>f(\alpha)=0</m>, we see that <m>\alpha</m> is algebraic over <m>\overline{F}_K</m>; it follows from <xref ref="cor_algebraic_algebraic_generated"/> that <m>\overline{F}_K(\alpha)</m> is algebraic over <m>\overline{F}_K</m>. Since <m>\overline{F}_K</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>, it follows from <xref ref="cor_alg_transitive"/> that <m>\overline{F}_K(\alpha)</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>. Thus <m>\alpha</m> is algebraic over <m>F</m>, in which case <m>\alpha\in \overline{F}_K</m> by definition. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We have shown that any nonconstant polynomial <m>f\in \overline{F}_K[x]</m> has a root in <m>\overline{F}_K</m>. We conclude (using <xref ref="rm_alg_closed"/>) that <m>\overline{F}_K</m> is algebraically closed, as desired.
