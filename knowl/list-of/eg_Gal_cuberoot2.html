Since <span class="process-math">\(\abs{\Gal(K/\Q)}=\abs{S_R}=6\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> must in fact be bijective. Lastly, since the group operation for both <span class="process-math">\(\Gal(K/\Q)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S_R\)</span> is composition of functions, <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> is clearly a group homomorphism.

<div class="para">As usual, we should think of the descriptions above as giving a “summary” of an automorphism <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> based on what it does to the elements of a generating set.

</div> <div class="para">For notational ease, let <span class="process-math">\(G=\Gal(K/\Q)\text{.}\)</span> We will use the cycle permutation representation of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> given in the table above. The lattice of subgroups of <span class="process-math">\(G\cong S_3\)</span> is something we have computed elsewhere. We provide it hear, along with a choice of generators of each subgroup. Note that our lattice is upside down: given two subgroups connected by an edge, the higher subgroup is a subgroup of the lower. <div class="image-box" style="width: 75%; margin-left: 12.5%; margin-right: 12.5%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/im_lattice_S3.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="Lattice of subgroups of \(S_3\)"></div> Applying the Galois correspondence to this lattice results in the complete lattice of intermediate fields of <span class="process-math">\(K/\Q\text{,}\)</span> oriented in the usual right-side up fashion. <div class="image-box" style="width: 75%; margin-left: 12.5%; margin-right: 12.5%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/im_lattice_cuberoot2.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="Lattice of intermediate fields of \(K/\Q\)"></div> We’ve gone ahead and computed <span class="process-math">\(K^{\{\id\}}=K\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(K^{S_3}=\Q\text{.}\)</span> The first equality is obvious: every element of <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> is fixed by the identity automorphism <span class="process-math">\(\id\colon K\rightarrow K\text{.}\)</span> The second equality follows from the fact that the two maps of the Galois correspondence are inverses of one another: since <span class="process-math">\(\Q\mapsto \Aut_\Q(K)=G\text{,}\)</span> we must have <span class="process-math">\(G\mapsto K^G=\Q\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">We’ve also added some information about the degrees of all the relevant extensions. The degrees of the extensions leading up to <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> are equal to the cardinality of the corresponding subgroup <span class="process-math">\(H_i\text{.}\)</span> The degrees of the extensions leading down to <span class="process-math">\(\Q\)</span> are given by the index <span class="process-math">\([G\colon H_i]\)</span> of the corresponding subgroup. Alternatively, these degrees can be computed using the tower law.</div> <div class="para">It remains to explicitly compute the various extensions <span class="process-math">\(K^{H_i}\text{.}\)</span> We can use what we already know about <span class="process-math">\(K/\Q\)</span> to help us along. For example, according to the diagram, there is exactly one subextension <span class="process-math">\(K^{H_5}/\Q\)</span> of degree <span class="process-math">\(2\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\Q(\zeta)/\Q\)</span> is such a subextension, we must have <span class="process-math">\(K^{H_5}=\Q(\zeta)\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Next, according to the diagram, the three extensions <span class="process-math">\(K^{H_i}/\Q\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(i\in \{2,3,4\}\text{,}\)</span> are the three subextensions of <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> of degree <span class="process-math">\(3\text{.}\)</span> Thus they must be the three cubic extensions <span class="process-math">\(\Q(\alpha_1), \Q(\alpha_2), \Q(\alpha_3)\text{.}\)</span> But which is which? The subgroup <span class="process-math">\(H_2\)</span> is generated by the <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> with permutation representation <span class="process-math">\((12)\text{.}\)</span> Since by definition this permutation fixes <span class="process-math">\(\alpha_3=\text{,}\)</span> and does not fix <span class="process-math">\(\alpha_1\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\alpha_2\text{,}\)</span> we conclude that we must have <span class="process-math">\(K^{H_2}=\Q(\alpha_3)=\Q(\sqrt[3]{2}\, \zeta^2\text{.}\)</span> Similar reasoning allows us to match the other degree-3 extensions, yielding the following completed lattice. <div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/im_lattice_cuberoot2_complete.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="Lattice of intermediate fields of \(K/\Q\)"></div>
