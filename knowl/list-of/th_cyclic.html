<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(K=F(\alpha)\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\alpha=\sqrt[n]{a}\)</span> is an <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-th root of an element <span class="process-math">\(a\in F\text{.}\)</span> We must show that <span class="process-math">\(K/F\)</span> is Galois, and that its Galois group is cyclic.

<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=x^n-a\text{.}\)</span> We claim that <span class="process-math">\(K=K_f\text{:}\)</span> i.e., <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> is the splitting field of <span class="process-math">\(x^n-a\text{.}\)</span> Since clearly <span class="process-math">\(K\leq K_f\text{,}\)</span> it suffices to show (by minimality) that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> splits completely in <span class="process-math">\(K\text{.}\)</span> But if <span class="process-math">\(\beta\)</span> is a root of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\alpha^n=\beta^n=a\text{,}\)</span> in which case <span class="process-math">\((\alpha/\beta)^n=1\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(\alpha/\beta\in \mu_n=\angvec{\zeta}\text{,}\)</span> showing that <span class="process-math">\(\alpha/\beta=\zeta^k\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(\beta=\alpha\zeta^{-k}\in K\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(\zeta\in F\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> splits completely in <span class="process-math">\(K\text{,}\)</span> as desired.</div>
<div class="para">To see that <span class="process-math">\(K/F\)</span> is separable, note that <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)=nx^{n-1}\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\character F\nmid n\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> is a nonzero polynomial whose only irreducible factor is <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is not a factor <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\text{,}\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\((f,f')=1\text{,}\)</span> and hence that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a separable polynomial. Since <span class="process-math">\(K=K_f\)</span> is generated over <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> by the roots of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(K/F\)</span> is separable.</div>

<div class="para">Lastly, we show that <span class="process-math">\(G=\Gal(K/F)\)</span> is cyclic. The usual argument shows that for any <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\in G\text{,}\)</span> we must have</div>

\begin{align*}

<div class="para">is injective. It is not difficult to show, using the usual arguments, that <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> is a group homomorphism. Thus <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is isomorphic to its image <span class="process-math">\(\phi(G)\leq \mu_n\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\mu_n\)</span> is cyclic of cardinality <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> and since all subgroups of cyclic groups are cyclic, we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(G\cong \phi(G)\)</span> is cyclic. Furthermore since <span class="process-math">\(\phi(G)\)</span> is a subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(\mu_n\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(\abs{G}\mid n\text{,}\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\([K\colon F]=\abs{G}\)</span> divides <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span>
